"Why link to the press article release?

[Here is the original open-access study if anyone's interested.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-18686-8)"
I still don’t understand how it is “mined”
How exactly do they measure climate damage in terms of USD?
[removed]
Wonder how they got 11k
Giving a dollar value to climate damage is weird. Or am I weird?
"Hydrocarbon energy is still far too cheap, and pricing should include environmental externalities."

"""caused $11,314 of climate damage"" ....what does that even mean?"

"Isn’t this kind of a false equivalency ? Bc if we switched to as much renewable energy as possible the electric to power the pc that is mining a bitcoin would have zero impact. 

The only reason it is harming the environment in the first place is because we still use nonrenewable  to power stuff."
"Miners care about economics.  If you charge more for fossil fuels then they won’t mine off fossil fuels.  

The issue here is that fossil fuels are far too cheap.  We need to cut all tax breaks and subsidies for fossil fuels.  

Time of use rates could also push miners to mine during peak renewables, provided time of use is cheaper when solar and wind are strongest.  

Raise prices on fossil fuels and this will stop immediately. Use that increased revenue to subsidize renewables more and we will get off the oil tit sooner, AND BTC would help this by paying those higher fees.  Then give tax breaks to ppl with the excess to so that they don’t get hit too hard by increases in prices.  Won’t be perfect but will accelerate things and the sooner we get to renewables the cheaper things get (cause they don’t have a fuel cost, anywhere near the same pollution cost, and don’t require brown fields)"

Batteries are also great for the environment
"Using energy isn't bad for the environment.  Generating energy in a dirty way is.  

Lots of things use energy.  Don't let these crooks make up crackpot numbers to distract you from the global heist they're pulling off and give a scapegoat for the damage they caused in the process."

I would like to see a comparison to the energy consumption of the traditional banking system.
I wonder how much damage the NFT silliness caused...

"Bitcoin mining is not generally out there pulling expensive energy for projects. Its generally going to use cheap stranded energy. The latest high-CO2 version is burning flared gas / methane. That would have been flared anyway and not mitigated. The real waste is to not develop the energy. I think you're assuming bitcoin is bad, but its' as green as whatever power source it consumes."

"Hillarious.  I didn't know you could run a simple wattage-to-climate change damage cost.  

My AC unit uses much more electricity than my miner. Does that mean my AC causes $30k in climate damage?  Also, it only cools down my house. At least mining crypto stabilizes an independent and efficient global financial system."
"First, you call out a single years worth of “climate damage” compared against multiple year total, most likely because if you estimate just using an average, it’s easy to calculate that BTC is responsible for a gargantuan 0.0004%. But let’s look at that in more relatable terms by changing the unit to seconds instead of dollars. 

Billion is a big number most people can’t actually relate to. The best I’ve heard is 1 thousand seconds is 16.67 minutes. A billion seconds is 31 years, 8 months, 8 days, 1 hour, 46 minutes, and 40 seconds. So if 1 second = $1 then you’re essentially saying it makes up ~3 years of a 380 year time scale. Even that isn’t the entire story though, let’s look at emission estimates in general. 

To start, are we talking Scope I or Scope II emissions? If it’s Scope III then it’s real easy…no one has a clue and any comparison is absolutely worthless. If it’s Scope II, I want to see the numbers because a ridiculously small percentage of buildings have even a single 3rd party installed meter, let alone the kind of sub metering required to differentiate between mining rig load and load from other sources like operations, biologicalal heat load from people in the building envelope, networking, etc. So most likely any Scope II estimate is using only the utilities meter and that’s a poor reference at best. Usually only the customer or utility knows monthly usage, as we don’t get monthly checking from researchers we have to assume the data is coming from utilities. Which beyond not having the technology to record even 15 minute intervals consistently, they have no incentive, or desire to report those numbers unless it’s a legal order with all the required paperwork in order. What about the regulators you ask? What about them? For anything less then annual reporting they have to request that data before it’s reported, then vet the accounting method and accuracy of those numbers (they spend time on accounting method but the utility commissioners aren’t about to do a lengthy true up process). Other than that you go off annual emission reports from utilities… … …I guess it has to be said that if you trust those numbers are “dead on gnats a**” accurate, you have an enviable view of the world. 

Finally, just because people don’t understand how electricity service works, and utilities sure as hell aren’t going to make sure you fully understand, very few realize the absolute benefits mining can offer reliable and resilient capacity, either as a load that’s extremely easy to curtail and probably simplest in terms of estimating precise amount of demand a utility can expect to decrease. In times of grid emergency due to peak demand, speed of controlling the demand is absolutely critical. There’s already programs in place that will pay up to $250 per kW of demand shed, imagine what a cargo container full of ASICS would get paid for shutting down. At 1.2 kW per rig (roughly) and a capacity of up to 200 rigs, you’re looking at $5,000 to stop mining for at most 4 hours. Something oil would never do nor would be capable of doing. The reverse is true as well, for over 100 years a major issue for utilities is overnight load. You can’t just turn off a power plant, it’s only cost effective to run them at low levels throughout the day. Since you can not have more power generated than is being instantly used without catastrophic damage, that means the utility has to have customers who require large amounts of energy through the night, often discounting the price to next to nothing, because it’s better to make some money then making none when they still have an operating expense. In some cases they’ll even pay for customers to use electricity during these hours of low demand. Enter miners, a guaranteed customer easily capable of using up any available energy that’s being generated. And again, there’s so few unknown or even inconsistent variables, that the estimates can be accurate af. 

Clearly this article is worthless. Does mining have negative effect on environment? Yup. But not even close to the oil industry. Every bit of energy used has some negative effect on environment, even the simple act of anyone reading this. So if the argument is anything negative to environment shouldn’t take place, then you’re holding court in the wrong energy-dependent forum."

That’s like saying playing video games is bad for the environment.

"I feel like titles like this are a bit disingenuous. The way we produce energy is bad for the environment and bitcoin “mining” requires a tremendous amount of energy. Bitcoin mining itself has little to no direct effect on the environment. As a species our only way forward is to actually produce more energy which will be required for space exploration, colonization, and advanced technologies. So the real solution is to improve the ways we create energy so they are less destructive to the environment. That’s why we need to heavily invest in safe nuclear and more research into fusion."
