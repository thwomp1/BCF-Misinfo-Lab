Note to self: Become a member of Congress.
"Friendly reminder: [48 members of Congress have invested in Pfizer](https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2020/04/dc-lawmakers-stocks-pharmaceutical-tech/), the least invested among those 48, 2.2 million dollars."

Are Canadian politicians insider trading or something?

I didnt know there was a congress in candia?üòÇüò≠ü§îü§î

Y‚Äôall know Canada and America are different countries right?

It's a different country lol

This sub is so close to realizing that global capitalism is the root cause of all humanity's biggest problems

Crazy! Maybe it's because US Members of Congress don't put their funds in Canadian banks....

"You're defending Putin and the oligarchs.
Tell me Russia bot how much of the loot putin collects gets to the average citizen
There is poverty in America and the poorest here live better than the average in Russia. 
We have our creature comforts.
And we can say whatever the fuck we want.
So fuck you Russian bot.  You filthy fucken bot"

I wonder what would happen to the banking industry if people withdraw all their money when they realize the Gov can freeze their accounts.

Never say never...

Didn't they do some shady stock shit right before 9/11?

Even if they wanted to it wouldn't make a difference. Those type if people have their money in offshore accounts.
"Their Bank Accounts Will be if Havent Been Seized Already. Look up EO-13808, ‚ÄúExecutive Order 13818-Blocking the Property of Persons Involved in Serious Human Rights Abuse or Corruption‚Äù. Signed Dec 20th 2017, Released By The Office Of The Press Secretary

I‚Äôm guessing 90-95% of Congress is in violation Of Human Rights Violations and Crimes Against Humanity."

That was Canadian banks freezing Canadian accounts. The congress is in say it with me‚Ä¶ the U.S.A

"SS: we live in a world where your bank account can be frozen for donating 15 $ to a freedom convoy but the lawmakers are okay to make millions from insider trading. Example. Nancy pelosi. Justin Trudeau‚Äôs Foundation Hold 40% Ownership of Acuitas, Manufacturer of Lipid Nanoparticles in the COVID mRNA Jabs"

"The new ""normal"": ordinary, peaceful and law abiding citizens are being categorized ""terrorists"", ""anti-vaxxers"", ""anti-government"", ""alt-right"", ""conspiracy nuts"" etc... while those who commit horrendous crimes against tens of millions of people in every nations, get to keep their ""job"", their influence and power, and of course the wealth they have accumulated at the expense of others..   
and dare you say anything about it, your will be banned, censored, ridiculed and canceled into oblivion"

"I mean go ahead have stock, but no politicians should be able have insider trading, the world needs to wake up."

Also that statement is a mashup of two different countries and doesn't really make any sense.

Why is this even in conspiracy lmao anyone can literally look up congress insider trading and confirm it themselves.

He‚Äôs not wrong

Nancy Pelosi has entered the chat

Yep

Kelly Loeffler and Richard Burr. Kelly Loeffler should be in prison right now.

Bastards!!! All of them!!

Forget that. What about maxwells customers?

I can't speak for Canada but in the US our founding fathers were kinda dumb. Let's let Congress regulate themselves..... It's worked out super duper good here.

"This is what happens when weak, greedy humans are told the war machine is coming.
My question is, who gets to go to the new societes on the shiny rockets being built on citizens slave labor and stolen tax dollars? I imagine they want me and my family to stay put lol. I'm not rocking that perfect ancient DNA.
History repeatng with a spicy technology/awkening twist... I can't watch fiction right now because the truth is way crazier and more interesting. I hope enough good humans wake up in time."

The real problem is when congress and senate get to control when the companies they invest in get to do certain things... then they get in early... its worse than insider trading

"I have found that most of reddit, and presumably most of twitter, has no clue what insider trading is. Insider trading is not simply having information the general public doesn't have.
Illegal ""*insider trading,*"" and trading on material non-public information, are two very separate things, but that seem the same to those unfamiliar with them.
Example: Many people/hedge funds get material non-public information (read: inside information) in ways which are perfectly legal. For example, they meet privately with management, or commission researchers to examine products or company locations, or go to industry conferences, or lots of other things. This is all legal ""*insider information.*""
To be illegal insider trading, material non-public information **must have been obtained via a breach of a fiduciary duty or other relationship of trust and confidence.** So if you give a CFO a suitcase full of cash for early access to earnings numbers, you‚Äôre in trouble. But if you overhear the CFO telling his CEO in an elevator that, ‚Äú*the analysts are going to be delighted,*‚Äù you‚Äôre fully within your rights to trade."

Not with that attitude

"The real, real problem is that the same criminal organization that is attempting overt world domination is doing so by controlling the financial system."

"In the 90s my social studies teacher told us insider trading for Congress was a ""perk of the job"".
Not sure how something that was actually legal for some reason would result in a bank account freeze but who knows.
Also not really a conspiracy, just something that needs to be legislated.
Finally this post reeks of Russian propaganda since what's in the news is a bunch of Russian oligarchs getting their accounts seized due to Putin's invasion."

"The wealthy and powerful will never act in a way that curbs their wealth or power. Even if a law is passed making it illegal for members of Congress or Senators from profiting in some way from their position, they'll simply ignore it and profit anyway... And who will stop them? Nobody. Because nobody can."

Nancy pelosi

Good thing they cant seize gold or silver. makes sense why the stock markets are down and ***gold and silver are up***!

Yes but you're talking about two separate countries here.

"Here‚Äôs the problem: asking people benefitting wildly from back-door donations, insider trading and immense connections to introduce legislation to stop it all.
It won‚Äôt just ‚Äúhappen.‚Äù"

Yeah fuck Dan Crenshaw

Exactly!!!!!

The same way they wouldn‚Äôt be there‚Ä¶

Which is legal for Congress members and certain other government workers.

"Does not matter which country politicians are from, they‚Äôre all self serving, crooked and  thieving cunts."

Maybe the real conspiracy is this sub‚Äôs mods letting low quality crap like this float to the top.
"unrelated mostly but a realizatoin. trump hates china but loves russia. Biden hates russia but loves China. Internally, our intelligence like DOD recognize that if ever russia and china teamed up is not ideal and  the only way to stop us consensus as publicly naming our enemies forcing them together is to split our opinion up on purpose."

I'm ready for pelosi and McConnell and the rest to pass on and free up seats for actual living humans

The best part about the Canadian public disturbance parade is that they got anti-vaxxers talking about *actual* conspiracies lmfaoooo.

"I get this is sorta a joke but I'll pretend I'm the responsible parent and remind everyone here: karma. You reap what you sow, more than you sow, and later than you sow it."

"Controversial opinion for this sub but pelosi hasn't done anything wrong with insider trading since it is allowed. Congress needs tonchange the rules and it sounds like it may happen sooner rather than later 
Also you should never be able to freeze sitting polititans accounts, or be able to stop them from sitting in their seat without a serious uphill legal effort. You may have cause to freeze someone's today and want to do it quickly because it's against the opposing side, but tommorow it may be used as a political weapon against your side. Governments change and tommorow the opposition can have a super majority and knee jerk changes today may have way more political leverage in the future"
"Yoooo
Pelosi is one of the greatest stock traders of our time tho. She must be clairvoyant or something. We could learn something from her 
/s"

Did they break laws?

Heyoooo

Your use of past tense as if that shit isn‚Äôt happening today!  Oh the power to make the laws and then to exempt oneself from the laws passed must be amazing!

What movie is it where a hacker hacks into banking system and dispersed the monies to people with like less certain amount? We should do that

also mine.
Never say never. Unlikely to happen soon. But it‚Äôs not out of the question eventually.

"I mean he is a giant cunt, but he ain't lying either."
You know who else never had their banks accounts seized? The Ottawa protestors.

And me üòé

Pelosi and the rest of the dinosaurs in both parties need to go.
It‚Äôs really not so bad. Just follow their trades and make some money lol. I miss the nancy tracker

It‚Äôs still wild to me that the people who make the laws and know what laws will be passed are allowed to trade stocks that‚Äôs like 4D insider trading

This dude gets it

Imagine a country where even the people who run it aren't allowed to cheat on their taxes without getting caught

You know who will not be seizing truckers bank accounts?? The truckers.

Just comply and they won't ~~kneel on your neck till you die~~ freeze your bank account.

"Meanwhile in America,any cop can pull you over,seize your car,money,and whatever else you have with no warrant,arrest or anything!Just‚ÄùYeah we‚Äôll be taking that ‚Äúand leave you on the side of the road with the clothes on your back!They take more money and property this way than all the burglary/robbery/shoplifting by AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE!"

"That'd be the day, pigs fly."

Too much dirt and blackmail hovering around everyone in that circle.

"I find it funny that all during the riots when they were looting businesses, etc they bailed those people out of jail! Now that this is happening they are out for blood."

Are we acting as though Canada and the US are the same country?

"I'm not into conspiracies, most are just nonsense, but your post is a FACT.  
I worked jobs where I had to get approval for stock trades or not allowed to own public stock at all, because it was a conflict of interest.  It is weird ""law makers"" don't think this is an issue.  
I mean it is not like they all make high six figure salaries already."

"Hard to prosecute those that decide on the laws. It's a pig trough, and has been since forever. Apple investments, bought by big pharma, silicon valley, oil and military contractors. But that's old news."

Yea it's pretty disgusting tbh

Gotta love double standards

I actually don‚Äôt understand all that.  Like if I knew something is going to fail I would also get out of it‚Ä¶.or visaversa. Is it bad to make decisions based on your knowledge about things? Or your beliefs in the future? Don‚Äôt we all do that? Or would do that if we had money to invest. If it‚Äôs wrong then investing money in say the convoys should also be considered wrong because it can benefit you. I have investments but they have done terrible. But if they happen to do good at some point in the future I wouldn‚Äôt want to be accused of cheating because I was told it would likely do well and get it all taken.

Good point. We should freeze the assets of the wealthy and take the means of production and give them to the working class.

Russian bot says what?

Thanks for that bit of information.
