This isn't a conspiracy theory. The rich really are conspiring against the rest of us.
He was especially right about that heckler being a cunt
Fucking legend
"This is why I am consistently annoyed at folks who keep bashing non-STEM educations. STEM is important, no doubt, but in case you haven‚Äôt noticed, the biggest problems we‚Äôre facing aren‚Äôt scientific and engineering ones, but rather social and political ones. We have a problems with empathy, not with growing food. We have problems with greed, not sustainable practices. We have problems with listening, not with being able to communicate with eachother. Most of all, we have problems with understanding in an era where knowledge is freely available and education is pervasive. 

People joke about degrees ‚Äúlesbian dance theory‚Äù and whatnot, but know this: if our world is destroyed, it will not be because of lesbians dancing. I promise you that."
"The funniest shit is that this is anti-capitalist, you hate capitalism but you're too brainwashed to see that so you keep punching down on marginalized people and shadowboxing individuals that are a product of unchecked capitalism"
"This isn't a conspiracy theory, it's called capitalism"
Bill Hicks was always right.
Moms comin‚Äô round to put back the way it oughta be
Ancaps understand this concept right up until you remind them that corporations are just as guilty as the government‚Ä¶ then suddenly this concept no longer applies
"**SS :üíïüïäÔ∏è The eyes of fear want you to put bigger locks on your doors, buy guns, close yourself off. The eyes of love instead see all of us as one. Here's what we can do to change the world, right now, to a better ride. Take all that money we spend on weapons and defenses each year and instead spend it feeding and clothing and educating the poor of the world, which it would pay for many times over, not one human being excluded, and we could explore space, together, both inner and outer, forever, in peace.** üïäÔ∏èüíï

**Bill Hicks**

This isn‚Äôt a conspiracy.
Alex Jones looked so different when he was Bill Hicks
"it's billionaires vs the rest of us, and the rest of us are losing."
"Hell, this isn‚Äôt even a conspiracy; they tell you up front"
I love Alex Jones
"The problem isn't that anyone has been GIVEN control of these resources, it's that they have TAKEN control. What needs to be understood is the mechanism of control, MONEY. 

As long as resources are owned by some and sold to others, as long as labor must be exchanged for them, some small group will ALWAYS take control. And they will NOT care about helping the world. 

What needs to be imagined is a world without money or property or work. Until we can build a better system then we will always end up in the same place."
Alex Jones used to be funnier while dropping truth bombs
This isn't a secret.
"The reality that‚Äôs what psychopaths do. It‚Äôs hard to crave power like that if you aren‚Äôt a psychopath. Nobody stops them because most people aren‚Äôt psychopaths. The best hope is you get a different psychopath that is more aligned to you.

It‚Äôs also why absolute monarchy is an underrated system. Monarchs are probably not much more likely than regular people to be psychopaths, and those that are usually don‚Äôt make it to the throne. Of course, their courts are usually full of psychopaths for the same reason, but at least they don‚Äôt have to listen to them if they don‚Äôt want to."
"A while back, I read an interview of a woman that lived in Soviet Russia. She said, ""we didn't have only one bread line because of a lack of resources. We had only one bread line because, if you're standing in the bread line for 8 hours, you can't be doing anything else."""
Anyone that doesn‚Äôt agree with this statement is a Psychopath.
Can‚Äôt emphasize this enough: our system rewards psychopaths and we glorify them. They are the worst among us but we elevate them when we should be doing the opposite. We should be building laws and societal rules that constrain their worst instincts.
He was right about a lot. That‚Äôs why they gave him cancer. BOOM CONSPIRACY.
I had some fella try telling me that Bill is Alex Jones.  Can you imagine?!?
That's literally what capitalism is. It's like this by design.
The conservatives are about to come out of the wood work to call you a dirty commie for daring to suggest there‚Äôs enough for everyone to go around
E.g. Donald J Trump
Nice to see this sub embracing Marxism
I find it really funny how most of the top posts in this sub recently have been calling out the inherent flaws of capitalism but when you say it out loud they get mad and call you a shill
[deleted]
I sometimes wonder if this fucker was poisoned or something. The government had to have it out for him.
And we as the people will continue fighting their wars because of it while hating eachother for the different beliefs that they beat into our heads.
Now imagine just posting these words yourself smh
"I think we the people have to put in the motion or have a set of ways to hold these pathetic people that are in power accountable for this madness. It‚Äôs truly insane the fact that they are doing corrupt crap and getting away with it because the people, the citizens are ‚Äúcomfortable‚Äù with the way life is to them. Now, I‚Äôm not the most education, most social person around these days but there has got to be a way to connect all of us together and stand up as one to get these awful, rotten egomaniacs out of office. They all should just retire."
"Yeah I dont know guys, I think I like these guys that have all the money/power. 
Have yall heard about this guy Klaus Schwab, I def like thee cut of his jib!"
He was 100% right.
Wasn‚Äôt this just Alex jones.
"Hi, Alex Jones."
Bill Hicks? You mean Alex Jones? Lol
You mean Alex Jones
Isn't he Alex Jones?
"R.I.P. Bill Hicks and long live Alex Jones!! 

^((If you know what I mean))"
100% true!
"Real Talk, thats a great quote.  

&#x200B;

.............what do y'all think about the theory that Bill Hicks death was faked and he is now Alex Jones?"
Bill Hicks was ahead of his time.
Only the good die young.
"To be fair, Bill Hicks was ALWAYS right"
100% absolutely.
"just a reminder: there is no food crisis in the world, simply a PROFIT crisis. we produce enough food worldwide to feed everyone 3.5x over. anyone dying of hunger is being murdered by corpo scum. same goes for water and clean energy at around 2.7x and 1.4x respectfully."
Ole Bill looks like a guy I know pretty well.. both speak some strong truth.
That right there is the true ‚Äúclimate crisis‚Äù
"I have been saying this for some now. The concept of authority is a man made idea, enforced by people who choose to accept it as a reality."
Spot on
Young Alex Jones making some strong points.
It's just a ride
"I had a coworker who believed every conspiracy, from the faked moon landing to 9/11 was an inside job. But she refused to believe that the rich were systematically trying to keep the poor down. Apparently that was just too CRAZY for her."
"Those dudes at Wall Street Bets have proven the very very simple fact, that when a group of motivated, half ass organized, bromos COULD FLIP THE FUCKING SWITCH on those hedgie cunts is enough proof for me that the people absolutely have the power to make a massive change if they really wanted to. Those guys are different than a lot of you folks. They had not just dollar signs in their eyes, they had a big ass middle finger thrown up there for those billionaires who lost it all. If you‚Äôre here talking left/right politics, or are a slouchy loser ass communist wishing to be handed an easy life, please stop. Stop wasting your time. No one with any logic and reason in their being agrees with your hilarious take on the world. I love a good conspiracy, but better dead than red all day long ya fuckin chodes. You commies make me sick."
Taxes.  I still don't understand why people aren't more upset over taxes.   I still don't understand how taxes is not the most important issue today.
What kills me is the propensity of conspiracy theorists to lean right while believing stuff like this. Hicks is advocating socialism. The workers owning the means of production instead of sociopathic capitalists that hoard civilization's accomplishments for themselves.
Hicks is never wrong.
I hope most of you are trolling with the Alex Jones is Bill Hicks thing.
Conspiracy fact
Alex Jones sure nailed it on this one.
"That's it.  There's not else to it.  Just that.

Oh yeah and üòéüï∂üçÑüëΩüõ∏‚ôæÔ∏èü§ëüí∞"
I heard a conspiracy that this is Alex Jones
"Because the rich unlike the poor/middle class actually have class consciousness.

They have us fight over brown,transgender,immigrants,etc etc etc. If your not on the side of labor at this point and your not making 5mil+ a year your have been effectively brainwashed. And you will actively vote and fight against your own best interests.

You have so much more in common than the homeless junkie down the corner than you do bezos. And people don't like that. But it's the truth. Wake the fuck up"
"And that, my friends, is why capitalism is pure evil."
"This wasn‚Äôt even a conspiracy when Hicks was _alive_. 

Corporate entities buying political influences at the detriment of society was a huge part of his on-stage ranting. He was aware of it from a young age and it formed a huge part of his act. It‚Äôs no more a conspiracy theory than when George Carlin was ranting about exactly the same thing in his own act."
Anastasia palazczuk is exactly like this.  She only cares about maintaining a position of power.  She never sounds honest when on camera
This isn‚Äôt a conspiracy at all. It‚Äôs factual
"Exactly, it's called capitalism."
"Yup,he was right then he died...Just like George Carlin"
Read Marx please for the love of fucking God please just read his work it explains literally fucking everything about modern society
The problem isn't that we've given the control. The problem is that we allowed them to seize it
Left facebook but still cannot escape these boomer edits
All land is owned or has been claimed. In todays world your only options are to rent property or pay exorbitant amounts to own a sliver of land. That seems like a big problem to me.
"So many comedian‚Äôs have such great truth and insight (Hicks, Carlin, Chapelle etc) Why do you think this is? Is it due to the skill in observation of the world that is required of a great comedian? Is it due to having a profession that you constantly riff and rant that they uncover human truths by accident? Or could it be that they truly are brilliant comedic philosopher poets that should be written about?"
I love when this sub uploads a meme that attacks Republicans. Except they didn't know that when posted. They think that some nebulous group controls things.
"Yeah, centralized power is cancer to society"
Thats Alex Jones baby!
"Sometimes I worry about the true nature of these ""greedy psychopaths"". Are they even human?"
Bingo.  Hicks was great.  I also loved when he called people in marketing and advertising Satan‚Äôs little helpers. üòÑ
It makes me happy to still see Bill being shared I‚Äôve been a fan since I was 15 years old and I‚Äôm 50 now so that‚Äôs a very long time I‚Äôm friends with his brother his best friends a lot of traveling comedians he toured with and nothing makes me happier than to see younger generations spread his word thank you
there goes that Alex Jones again
Alex Jones was so based in his old career before he had to fake his death as Bill Hicks.
"Dude, that's Alex Jones wdym"
End the fed.
I don‚Äôt take my wisdom from comedians.
And they‚Äôre called politicians
"He's right. There is no scarcity of anything. It's all created by your so-called leaders you so-called elected. And the racisms that states POC are too dumb to fill out simple forms to get a state ID to vote. 

It's a big issue for those brand of Democrats to the far left called Democrat Socialists (communists) and those scum Repubs who blindly agree with them."
"God dammit, right a 1000x over."
Yes libertarianism is the best mode of politics. Get the gov out my ffing business
Bill Hicks is Alex Jones. Alex Jones is Bill Hicks.
Good quote and Bill Gates is leading the psychopaths.
This is actually Alex Jones. 'Both' are heroes
"Tucker Carlson grew up with the rulers  and he has it right. Not one of them should in the ruling classes. They are stupid, paranoid and lack any leadership talent."
You mean Alex Jones?
Bill hicks? You mean Alex Jones?
Alex Jones
Alex hasn‚Äôt changed much
Alex Jones was right.
They killed him
Sure is
I can't remember the occasion when I gave them control of these things.
"> ""given"""
Solution: End the state.
"Great mind, epic heart, and incredible human being."
the people who actually want the Ring of Power should never be trusted with the Ring of Power.
Why phrase it so accusatorially tho. Why is it the audience's fault any more than it is his own?
Oh fun! Now do Randy Pan The Goat Boy!
always has been
Wow it‚Äôs almost as if it‚Äôs capitalism that‚Äôs the issue. No shit
Damn pretty much sums it all up
We never gave them anything they took it.  We dont have the means or support to take it back.
"The problem is inaction of the non psychopaths. Psychopaths get power because they seek it at a high level. Most people don‚Äôt want the pressure of leading. So the competition consists of psychopaths vs psychopaths, election after election"
Kill Bill is what their saying now!  You've gone and changed everything.
"Why is this posted on r/conspiracy, this is just plainly obvious fact..."
"None of us gave control, at least not in a single act. Rather, we were born into a system which is designed to keep them in control, and the methods whereby that control could be taken back are convoluted and often illegal."
Because they know that without that control they would be the helpless victims of someone with more power than them
I wonder how his butthole smelled like
Alex Jones was so much cooler back in the day‚Ä¶
You mean Alex Jones?
He looks a lot like Alex Jones there. Found the side quest conspiracy in this post.
"Money, food and land - back in peoples hand!"
"> For the love of money is the root of all evil

Timmy 6:10"
Ahem... we didn't GIVE shit! It was taken from us
Alex Jones.
No war but class war.
"‚ÄúMany people have been on the ride a long time, and they begin to wonder, ""Hey, is this real, or is this just a ride?"" And other people have remembered, and they come back to us and say, ""Hey, don't worry; don't be afraid, ever, because this is just a ride."" And we ‚Ä¶ kill those people. ""Shut him up! I've got a lot invested in this ride, shut him up! Look at my furrows of worry, look at my big bank account, and my family. This has to be real."" It's just a ride. But we always kill the good guys who try and tell us that, you ever notice that? And let the demons run amok‚Ä¶‚Äù"
100%
"In this picture, he resembles young Alex Jones with a mullet. And yes, he's right!"
trust the mullet
"Not really conspiracy. It‚Äôs happening around us everyday- the rich people around me are so much richer than me 10 years ago, while the number of homeless and starving is only going up. 

If only the richest 1% part with 1% of their wealth‚Ä¶"
The problem is you give just enough to the poor that they're fat and complacent. Everyone else risks too much if they step out of line
They even call themselves a family. Wanted me to sing for my dinner.
"Holy friggin epic, it‚Äôs Alex Jones!1!!!!11! /s"
"This is exactly what we‚Äôre facing in South Africa..we are having what we call load shedding (when power goes out at certain times of the day).
The load shedding isn‚Äôt because were running out of coal to generate electricity, but we‚Äôre having it for other silly reasons that don‚Äôt make sense, sometimes they won‚Äôt even give a reason at all"
But but ‚Ä¶. that‚Äôs capitalism! Wait ‚Ä¶I‚Äôm confused
The real conspiracy is Bill Hicks is Alex Jones
F
Bill was fucking right about everything. RIP
"I once saw a video where thanos had someone explain to him that supply lines and greed were the real problem, not population."
It's just human nature that we strive to empower ourselves as much as possible even if that means oppressing other people. (Now that could be the case because we are all descendants of oppressive kings that took all the women) the only way to avoid oppression is to have built in systems in our societies that limit the power of the individual.
Profound stuff bro you should write a book
How is this a conspiracy theory? This is just how capitalism + human nature work.
It's a lot.
Yes the Bourgeois
Unfortunately yeah.

Who is the you one this sentence and which psychopaths are we referring to. It‚Äôs said as if there was a choice and not really just a product of societal systems. I‚Äôd rather have society than be a caveman
Who is the Bill Hicks of today?
Couldn‚Äôt have summed up the Republican Party any better myself
Aka Republicans
"Can we get the source material for this quote? I know footage that was previously unreleased could have been released since, but when I was younger I listened to Bill religiously and went through his entire catalogue, and over it many, many times -- and this quote is new to me."
"Okay people let‚Äôs set some traps then, lay some tender meat on a preverbal bear trap and catch ‚Äòem red handed doing the public dirty. I bet if you reveal who the bad actors are and cut them off like cancer, we can begin to heal. 

Help me out here, what are some creative ways we could trick and publicly shame the wealthy and powerful for obvious disregard for the prosperity of the total US Team?"
House ownership should be revoked after it's been unoccupied for a while
"one of my great pleasures is being from Houston and being able to meet people that knew Bill Hicks and Sam Kennison.  

Kennison made HUGE waves as he was a Reverend in The Houston Heights.  At some point the Church decided he needed to leave after they saw the content of his Comedy routines.  He responded by Duct Taping himself to the Crucifix out in front of the church until they realized he really was about being a Reverend.

Hicks touched a LOT of lives.  if you know comedy the shows are actually usually pretty small and usually you can get drinks w the comedians and get to know them.  Bill did this a lot.  They both did some pretty regular shows at the LaughStop for sometime and wow did Bill really win people over just by being honest.  Sam was a bit less outgoing apparently."
