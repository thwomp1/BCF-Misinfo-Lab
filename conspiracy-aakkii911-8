"Thanks, television's Hercules from the 1990s!"
I wonder what Xena has to say about this.
Kevin Sorbo is not on the side of that statement that he thinks he is.
[removed]
Lol I can‚Äôt even tell if this sub is a parody or not anymore
Idiocracy is real
[removed]
I don‚Äôt know if I would be using Sorbo as a spokesperson for my cause.
Kevin's tweet wasn't silenced.
"Huh, I wonder what a lot of people on this sub would think about this quote when it‚Äôs intelligent people talking about something like climate change, or I don‚Äôt know, a deadly virus? ü§£"
Kevin is one of the stupid people that doesn‚Äôt want to be offended.
Much insight from the guy that played Hercules on basic cable 30 years ago.
"Ah, yes, Kevin ""Antifa pretending to be Trump supporters attacked the capital"" Sorbo. Of course."
"Wasn't Sorbo a die hard Trump supporter?

I don't think he's as smart as he thinks he is."
Ironic source
I didn't realize that Kevin was so up to date on the people trying to take books out of school libraries.    Thanks for the reminder Kevin.
"OP: *Posts Kevin Sorbo tweet unironically*

Me: DisapPOINTED!!!"
"The fact that this shit is upvoted with all the comments [righteously] pointing out the idiocy shows that this sub has been astroturfed to hell.

Edit: grammar"
We live in a world where people think Kevin Sorbo is intelligent.
"Why not repost Sorbo's series of tweets from last January 6th??(1.6.21)

And then we can all have a chat about smart people, stupid people and silence.

(They're probably deleted but that's okay people like me save stuff ike that)

Note: This is extremely well said.  But Sorbo is not smart not silent & clearly not self-aware"
"By ""intelligent people,"" he means his aunt from Missouri and by ""silenced,"" he means Facebook put a lil banner on the bottom of her post.

What a bunch of professional victims."
[deleted]
Sorbo drank the qanon kool-aid. It‚Äôs a shame Hercules turned out this way.
Intelligent people like‚Ä¶.Kevin Sorbo lmao
"I believe the less offensive term is, minimally excellent."
This is definitely the opposite lol. The stupid people spreading misinformation are definitely at the forefront. Social media is basically there best friend.

"Scientific studies can be easily misinterpreted by those not specializing in the subject, let alone non-scientists. A lot of people cannot understand risk:reward or do not want to spend the time learning it, so instead of saying that contagion of a disease is proportional to the inverse square of distance, they simplify it by saying ""stay 6 feet away"". This is not being silenced, this is simplifying things to make it more convenient for everyone."
"Lmao nobody's silencing you, you dingbat"

fucken dingleberry..."
"And yet, Kevin Sorbo is still always offended."
"One way to quickly make a cause go to complete shit, is to have Kevin Sorbo as a spokes person. This guy peaked on a third rate channel."
This rings especially true in regards to YouTube's removal of the dislike.
The hilariously sad part of this is: pretty much everyone reading thinks *they* are in the intelligent group.
"It's funny growing up before social media.  I still don't consider it censorship or being silenced for someone to be kicked off social media.  

These are private businesses who can make their own rules and kick off whoever they want.  That's our system.  We could have a government run social media where they couldn't just make up their own rules but I don't think anybody wants that."
"Yes, but Kevin is one of the stupid people.  Definitely not a guy you want to quote to make your point."
Kevin Sorbo of all people. KEVIN SORBO.
"Real intelligent people don't even think they're intelligent...this tweet is an obvious dog whistle to those living with Dunning-Kruger, and I think we know who those people are."
"[""Hercules, Hercules, Hercules, Hercules!""](https://youtu.be/WR1UiNdQnDw)

Thanks Eddie Murphy!"
"This is the funniest post of 2022, hands down."
"""The tv man said I'm smart!!!"""
And every person reading this thinks they‚Äôre the intelligent one.
Must be why this subreddit hasn't been shut down yet
Kevin Sorbo obviously still audible
Why is this upvoted?
Who offended Kevin Sorbo?
Coming from Kevin sorbo? How's the conspiracy not that these tweets are legit manufacturer outrage
Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn
Oh the irony
"Am I missing something? All the comments are hating on him for stating something true.  

He did not state or imply that he was intelligent or stupid. He is making an observation. No one thinks Sorbo is a genius and if he thought he was then he would not have resorted to relying on physical appearance and acting in bad tv shows for a career."
Says the guy who's pretty much bottom of the barrel dumb.
Clearly that‚Äôs not true since he‚Äôs offended.
Lol!  I always got a laugh at this sub.  Y‚Äôall are rising stars with posts like this! Dude is fucked in the head.
"Just so you know  this is the kind of person you praising:
https://twitter.com/ksorbs/status/1410530321431470085?t=C0zO7D2bnpCxQbDLSifOLw&s=19

XD"
"Oh Kevin, you're not on the intelligent side buddy. You played Hercules on TV, sit down."
I actually think he has a point. I'm just guessing we don't agree on who's stupid and intelligent.
**DISAPPOINTED!!!**
"This isnt as deep as you thought it was. Say whatever you want, nobody really cares? Yall are strange."
[removed]
"In the name of the father, the son, and the holy kevin sorbo. Kevin Sorbo, who was hercules, hallow be thy tweets..."
Oh no. Gulag time for Kev.
"This guy has a real point. Conspiracies aside, it does feel like we're having to metaphorically bubble-wrap everything more and more so we don't hurt the feelings of the sensitive slowflakes out there.

That's stupid. Those sensitive snowflakes need to get over themselves. It's a tough world out there, deal with it."
"And Sorbo clearly isn't being silenced, so..."
"Well, he's not being silenced."
Kevin Sorbo is perpetually offended.
I guess the stupid people offended here are the ones that said the virus would magically dissappear after the election and we wouldn't hear about covid anymore.
Who has been silenced as to not offend stupid people?
This is the whole truth it‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt get any better than this
"true, but its been going on for decades now, where stupid is rewarded and celebrated and intelligence mocked and bullied, only need to look at American high school football to see this in action!

both our governments and our education systems notoriously put stupid on a pedestal.

why? you can herd stupid people, **intelligent people refuse to be herded .**"
Love this quote. So true.
"SS: we live in times where war is peace, freedom is slavery and ignorance is strength. Also 2+2 = 5.
If you are easily offended, you are easily manipulated"
"Look at all the bot-like posts on this forum that talk trash about this sub and its members. It almost seems coordinated to a point, right? And further, a good indicator that ""most"" of these people (keyword: most) are bad actors is for the simple fact they are not a part of this community. Sad."
Based
Ricky Gervais quote
Which one is he?
So that the sheep keep complying *
And it‚Äôs making people like Kevin Sorbos seem cogent
"It's a cute quote but in which time since 1963 didn't it apply?

Vague, ambiguous slogans are the *best* slogans to get behind."
Such a mastermind. Glad he's here when I can't find Ja Rule
cough Trump cough
Hella brigading goin on. Absolutely weird for such a low tier post. And 2.5k+ upvotes? This shit is all kinds of suspicious
Kevin Sorbo has all the brainpower and magnetism of an eggplant üçÜ I'd rather kick sand in my own eye than read about his thoughts on something lol
And that's why he's still allowed to talk
Then how am I reading a Kevin Sorbo tweet?
"Then why do I keep hearing from Xena with a Pena?? Someone get this guy a gig, he‚Äôs clogging up the internet!!"
Look up irony in the dictionary and it's just a picture of this tweet.
"If you are quoting Kevin Sorbo, you are not the smart person you think you are."
Literally was just having this same convo yesterday with my husband
Cry me a river boy
The stupid people think they are intelligent and get triggered when people don't want to listen to them and the experts/ intelligent people are being ignored.
Corrupted wont be offended
"But there are a lot of stupid people running their mouths on both sides. 

Pro Vax and Anti Vax, Republican and Democrat, Radical left and Far Right. 

Lot's of stupid people running their mouths when they have no basis for science behind their views on both sides."
There are still a few celebrities with morals and common sense
"Truly a hero, Hercules."
Hercules being based will always make me smile.
"this is wrong. Intelligent people are silenced to keep people in line and from not realizing the truth. People are only offended by the truth cause it goes against their belief that the government would not commit murder. Censorship was never, ever been done to stop people from being offended. It is always to limit the spread of truth so corruption and tyranny can flourish. I'm offended that censorship even exists at this level. They don't give a fuck about offending me, so they can all fuck off."
I love Kevin Sordo
"It's the party of feels (the left) silencing people. They are officially the party of censorship.

Snowflakes downvoting because they can't handle the truth. Big tech and msm are all on the side of censorship if it means protecting a narrative."
Wow. From hercules himself. I absolutely loved the series.
Disappointed!!
I find myself more and more hard to relate with people as the days progress
"This sub is getting political, in an obviously leaning direction...."
Like those pro-vaccine mandates that have to stay silent in order not to offend those pro-freedom folks.
"Sorbo is not intelligent, he's a washed up male model who can only get gigs on pure Flix Christian movie crap ü§£ü§£ü§£"
it is ironic to post this in this sub where all the antivax people are
One of the interesting things about the last 2 years is seeing what celebs/sports figures think about the current world events
"Bit late for this Kevin.

Hasans ban is already over."
And I think this illustrates a problem. It isn‚Äôt intelligent v stupid. There‚Äôs plenty of that all around. If it was that easy we‚Äôd have fixed it by now.
"I wish they were stupid, then it would make sense."
Prepare for your personal brigade...
It‚Äôs okay‚Ä¶ keep the people with intelligence safe by letting the unintelligent think they‚Äôre right. Kind of like babysitting.
This sounds familiar...
"Careful. A post like this might get you banned.

And a comment like this . . . Oh no. What have I done"
"So same shit, different time. Got it."
Thanks former TV star!
We live in a time where stupid people call themselves intelligent and can always find even stupider people to agree with them.
*Insert Inigo Montoya face here*
By other intelligent people with a plan.
"Love his takes, he is clearly one of the good guys. But he is also definitely someone's mouthpiece - I wonder who's.

We always talk about the evil forces at play, but we don't often mention what seems like the remnant of a benevolent and once dominant faction - those behind ""the original programming""."
"Uh, we have ALWAYS been living in those times. Like for all of human history. There never existed any period of time where things have not been like this."
Good old Hercules!
A very small minority of stupid people are actually offended. It's just the excuse the elites use to censor any conversation that goes against their narrative.
"Before I make up my mind on the validity of this statement, I‚Äôll need to hear Chachi‚Äôs thoughts. It‚Äôs the ‚ÄúTwo Has-beens‚Äù rule. My moral compass."
Kevin is a raving anti-vax
"Liars are not stupid, they are actually pretty smart. In truth, they are fools including those who censor or support censorship, but so are those who upvote this post thinking that it has to with inteligence. Wisdom has nothing to do with inteligence."
What if Kevin Sorbo offends my intellect?
"Then say something intelligent or offensive, instead of a stupid fucking quote that isn't even yours..."
An actor that can actually read a science book is not welcome in Hollywood. Just like a politician with a soul is not welcome in DC.
He's not wrong.
"I find this right wing, it must be stopped, highly offensive"
Hercules knocking it out of the park
Fact!
Truth
And the agency responsible is _feminism_.
Captain Dylan Hunt is freaking amazing! My childhood hero : )
Is there anyway sorbo and mypillow guy and maybe The Amazing Mr Dr Robert Malone MD could somehow have a baby that would lead us all through this messy world?
"I would say it is the time when stupid people rule the world. It was gearing up in the background for decades. Sadly not enough smart people payed attention, or if they did, didn't know what to do about it."
this is happening in csgo
"It starts in grade school ""Let's let someone else [not as smart] answer the question"""
That's every time.
yes that‚Äôs definitely what‚Äôs going on
"Started to think I was right when I never liked so called smart ppl at school.
When trouble comes, they're the ones parting with the manipulation."
Millennials with their goddamn participation trophy's.
If you're going to quote Sorbo this is one of his weaker selections.
More like so stupid people won‚Äôt feel stupid LMAO
This
I guess he isn't wrong?
3662 omg that's highly concerning and overall sad.
well this pretty much sums it up for me.
"We live in a time where celebrities think their opinions matter.

Oh snap."
