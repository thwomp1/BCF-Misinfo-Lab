He was able to have his home paid for at 25. That’s the real conspiracy. the good old days.
"My grandmother bought her home in Austin for 18,000 in the late 50's. Now it's worth 1.3 million. The property taxes are astronomical even with her exemptions. Living on a fixed income means that her taxes eat up most of her SS. She also had a few hundred acres in Travis county. Before the boom she had investors convince her to sell for super cheap and she had no choice financially. All the generational wealth that had been in our family since our early settlement is gone because the banks are greedy assholes."
"Its not at all uncommon for property taxes to exceed $10K a year in certain areas. Imagine that, an extra ~$1K a month ON TOP OF an already ridiculous mortgage payment. Another reason why home ownership feels like a pipe dream for me. What a joke."
"No one is talking about inflation over the past (I would guess) 40+ years, and how it makes comparing simple dollars over that long time frame meaningless."
Property tax is just pure theft.
"And then the government squanders the money taken from property taxes. If there wasn’t so much corruption and waste, people might not complain as much about the over taxation."
I agreed. I still think there should be no property tax on individuals owning a single home. Companies yes. If a person buys multiple homes then at the least a consideration.
Retirees should be living tax free. Just let them live out their days.
"Trim the fat in our convoluted, Jackson Pollock shit show of a bureacratic nightmare web of useless shit. I'm genuinely surprised I'm not taxed for the oxygen I breathe every year."
Yet if billionaires living in California didn't pay any taxes to the state that would also be a conspiracy
I believe in Mexico there is no property tax.  Find a nice place and keep your money.
"Amen! Paid off my house, still oaying ""rent"" via taxes in the thousands, have to save for it every year."
"Fucking Midwest. We’re looking to move to Ohio and holy crap, those property taxes are INSANE. Up in Salt Lake City they were capped at an incredibly low amount. We saw $2M homes that only paid $3k/year in property tax there! Vegas also caps primary residence very low. But the Midwest… that part of the country just truly hates its citizens and assumes they won’t know any better"
Not exactly a conspiracy. It's just that the government. doesn't give a shit about people and their well being and that fact is in plain sight
"In the US, unlike in Europe, real estate property is not supposed to stay in the hands of regular middle class for generations, rather it or a new construction in its exact place is meant to begin re-circulating as quickly as possible (barring losses to the bank), hence the unaffordable property taxes in many states. The idea is to keep the majority of people in as permanent a state of precarity as possible for reasons of elite political control, but also to keep real estate, and bank profits concomitant with it (the US is, after all, a bankocracy) recirculating in the market within a span of years, at most decades, but preferably not a human lifetime. So ultimately you're not really meant to actually own your own home because that in fact means you have ceased to participate in that particular capitalist market place for a significant period of time."
"SS : The best things in life are free, but sooner or later the government will find a way to tax THEM. You Will Own Nothing and you will be happy."
We are tax cattle aren’t we?
" they do that to control, it's not because it's fair or suppose to be.  


Paying to live on the earth you take care of is why many call it prison planet & why scripture said money was the root of evil.  What's next paying to breath air \^\^"
This guy is only 27
"I bought a house in 2017 (at 28), since then my taxes increased from 2200 to 4800 dollars. In another 5 years at this rate I won’t be able to afford to keep my house. This man has a point.
I come from a poor family, and am the first to make it I to the suburbs, and soon will be kicked right back out."
Laws like these are what force people to sell their property to oligarchs.
he's doing the math very well and he knows that legal body is using math also to take advantage of people.
"All governments do two things.  They may do many things, but these two things are common to all governments.

* **The systematic plunder of a captive population**
* **The arbitrary enrichment of a select few**"
"I consider myself pretty left leaning, but expecting someone to just uproot their life and move somewhere else because they can no longer afford property taxes for a house they've paid off and lived in for 20+ years is cruel."
"I mean we can debate property taxes (which are complicated, I think they kind of suck) but the idea he mentions social security in his sign is incredible."
"I agree it is plundering the people in certain areas for no reason. In my area property taxes are outrageously high. My houses taxes are about $16,000 this year and I only have a 3 bedroom 1.5 bath with attached garage on a single lot. The town roads have potholes you could plant oak trees in, and every winter we need to call the public works and threaten them to do their jobs for snow removal cause they skip our street which is a dead end street and me and my two neighbours get screwed with massive snow hills and can’t see the crossroad coming out. By the time I pay off my house I will have paid it twice over in taxes to the city. Fucking robbery is what it is. At least fix the bloody roads and keep the public services working right if you gut us like that."
We never truly own a damn thing do we……
Plot twist: He lives on 7500 acres of land.
"so if you don't pay your taxes they take the house, doesn't it seems like living in rented place.

everyone should be allowed to own a small without any taxes, that's real ownership of land."
You don’t own property. You lease it from the government
Hell I am 23 and I don’t even have have enough money in my account to get groceries right now lol
the real conspiracy is social-media-ization of Reddit so that we waste our energy on replying to one-lined pictures or posts.
This is one of the worst things for me. If you live off you your land off grid 100% and don't pay taxes people will show up with guns too haul you away or worse if you refuse/resist. Absolute insanity. Why even by land at this point ... oh i guess that is the point
The reality of where we’re at today goes back to the end of the USA under president Wilson.  It may have formally ended earlier but it really kicked into high gear with the creation of the Federal Reserve System of plunder and the creation of debt at birth.
He forgot to say his home sites on a thousand acres now worth 8 million dollars.
Arrest the government for treason and crimes against humanity
He's not wrong
"Do people not understand how taxes work? This is painfully ironic, he's complaining about his social security check getting cut while also complaining about taxes in the same sentence.  Lmfaooooooo"
I'm priced out as well where I am and am now priced out anywhere near where any of my family live. Ill have to live in OK or something if I want to buy a home. I kind of do want to move but I wish the huge housing bubble never happened. People got greedy and they used a system to take advantage of it at the cost of people like you and me because millions of us stand no chance ever and will be forced to move if we ever want a home unless we partake in this scam if we had in wage increase but even then we would be getting ripped off. Then we will have to be over taxed on a seriously over inflated home.
Once I own my house absolutely nothing will fucking get me out of it. If property taxes get so bad that I can't afford them il fucking die in my house guns blazing before they can drag me out of it.
Sad isn't
"Property tax is absolute theft. As far as I can see, a man's land shouldnt even be considered part of the country. Its his own dang country.
Because of property tax, no one can ever own land in the United States, you only rent it."
Tax money for me but not for thee.
"Property taxes are much lower in my home country. I don't know or understand why americans pay so damn much.

if i were american, i would retire in mexico."
"If you have to pay someone to live on something you 'bought' you didn't buy it, you are leasing it."
"This is fucking crazy to me. None of the people who are in office right now were not our forefathers. Nobody alive or distant cousins are in power.
Yet they have the power over the land we live on. 
If we build a home blood sweat and tears out of our pockets, paying lumber sales tax, land property taxes along the way and STILL something they did not build legally can AND will SEIZE your home because you didn’t pay property taxes. Ben Franklin was right only thing certain in this damn life is death and taxes. It’s doesn’t stop. You go to prison? You still pay income tax. Unless your homeless but it’s illegal to be homeless so you get put in a place and made to be apart of the labor force to guess what? PAY taxes!"
"In many countries you are not eligible for Social Security or disability benefits if you own property. As a result, if you become disabled and unable to work, you are forced to sell your house and use up that money before you get any help from the government."
Is that USA? You guys getting drilled in the anus every step of the way by gov & friends aren't you?
"Taxation is theft. We pay taxes on everything we buy after we pay taxes on the money we make. We pay taxes on inheritance after that money was taxed once already. We’re even paying taxes for the money we send to Ukraine even if people disagree with it. When is enough, enough.  There’s many problems in America that we can use our taxes for but we end up sending it all over the world, contributing to other problems. This money could help eliminate the problems we have in our own country."
"Here in Pennsylvania, a local township to me doesn’t have their own police force because they don’t want to pay more taxes, so they are served by the State Police from the gas taxes everyone pays.  Our gas taxes are diverted from road repair to pay for the neighboring township’s state police coverage."
My property tax is 17k a year. New York sucks.
"The value of money is not the same, but it is crazy the taxes for residency"
Homestead exemption
"Well sell it, it's been 50years so the value should be a lot higher, then retire"
Donald Trump did jack shit about making housing affordable for the bottom 70%.
"Ok but you live on public money 100%. this problem isn't the way you frame it.

edit: and none of us are going to be able to use *our* social security as a pension either. you lucky bastard"
"If you have to pay rent (property taxes), then the person collecting the taxes owns the home.  I hate that I came to that realization so late in life."
"Damn, I wish we had taxes like that here. As it is people buy up and sit on property, making tax free capital gains, using those gains to buy more property. All the while fewer and fewer people can afford to buy a home for their family."
 You mean legalized plunder you get in the form of a SS check every month?
"ehm..welcome to our world boomer.
Coffee and doughnuts are to your left..bathroom is to the right. Dont bother gettibg comfortable because you cant."
What if he only paid $6000 to build his house?  What if he didn’t pay much into social security so he only gets $400 a month?
"If he was 25 when he built the house, he look to be atleast 70, that was 45 years ago. The house couldn't of cost him more then 50-100k to build. That's a fucking mansion building it yourself. 

How is it costing him 50% of his check to pay the taxes on the original price of his house? 

Can you imagine how much that would cost these days? Jesus Christ its astronomical compared to his payments. 

The payments are fucked in general, but he honestly has it easy compared to everyone else."
He doesn't realize that the government needs his money in order to forgive the 1.9 trillion in student loans of the gender studies majors
"How is he complaining about paying taxes with his social security check? By the time I’m his age there won’t be social security left. Yet my  taxes are paying for his social security check. 

You’re welcome fucker. 

Must be nice having a paid off house and free money."
But this is what all governments do: Pillage and Plunder! Change my mind.
"The utter irony of complaining about how much money the government is *taking*...... out of the check the same government is *giving* him

That's Italian-chef-kiss quality cognitive dissonance"
Everything three years??? I pay every year!!!
"Hot take: Buying land when things cost a nickel doesn't entitle you to live there forever at 0 cost. Either don't be poor or sell it for $1M or whatever and move the fuck out.

We have a giant looming black cloud of shit stemming from a lack of affordable housing. Octogenarians sitting on prime real estate for 80 years should be discouraged."

What’s this chad doing collecting social security?  Get out and get a job man !
Pay your taxes boomer. Freedom isn't free.
“Paying for what you own. Now that’s a scam.” - Dee from It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia
Would need to see the original value of the house and the yearly checks to determine if he just doesn't understand how the value of money has changed or if he's legitimately spending perhaps close to several hundred thousand in property taxes.
"This isn’t a conspiracy but it is a good lesson. Even though you may be able to afford to buy something, that doesn’t mean you’ll be able to afford to maintain it."
I feel like it's only fair considering they bag on the younger generation while ignoring current cost of living. Guess they only complain when it suits them
"So he’s taking out of social security and not leaving it for the next generation, just so he can sit on his butt not working?  Damn communist!"
"Todays facebook meme brought to you by the ""Yahoo Mountant Dew!"" guy"
"50% of [his] what?

What does he use 50% of to pay taxes?"
Now you know what the problem is when a group of criminals take over the printing press and flood the world with “money” that do nothing but create infinite inflation.
"Boomer cries in boomer voter currency which votes against a society that can *affordably* help & educate themselves, rear children and maintain health which sustains the elderly like himself. Does this mean he’s regretful in his choices in life or just that he’s experiencing the affects of his own generation’s decisions? Maybe he was drafted and had no choice in the matter. Either way, his gen’s fuckery is the gift that keeps on giving."
Thanks republicans for keeping your corporate masters happy
This poor bastard
"You’re paying the government to back your property with force. You don’t own land and things, that’s a man made concept."
We should tax the boomers more.
