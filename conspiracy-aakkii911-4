I was in the shitter most of that time.
Most people only repeat things they believe will bring them increased social standing and clout. We are so primed and ready for the social credit score.
Is this a random tweet? WTF?
"""Why are people mad at this when this exists!"" doesn't really do much to excuse that person's actions. 

Where does that line of reasoning end?

Who cares about anything at all when we're just a bunch of monkeys on a mud ball in space."
"So let me get this straight, as the conspiracy subreddit, the likes of Jesse Smollett self inflicted racial attack, and CNN Producers sleeping with staff are bigger stories than the ex president having presidential files recovered from his multimillion dollar private golf resort???"
"Oh yes, the great defining conspiracy of our time 

The Joe Rogan dilemma


What a joke"
"What‚Äôs the conspiracy here?

Or this just another post that‚Äôs ‚Äòliberals are the real bad guys‚Äô so ignore the crazy that I like."
"Because you should only investigate the ""left"", also wasn't Maxwell convicted?"
It's not a fucking conspiracy dumbass. This sub is so dogshit now
"One fucking day.

Can this sub go one fucking day without shilling for literally the most popular and widely circulated podcast on the planet.

Fucking clown world"
[deleted]
"Actually, most of the stuff on the list was pretty public, so there was no need for some one to comb through every word."
The real conspiracy is making tards like you think these things are an actual conspiracy.
Don't forget about 4 years of Trumps family steeling money from the citizens of this country
"Since you have the time to make a sandwich, where were you during 9/11?"
Nursing home genocide what‚Äôs up with that?
What about Frump's entire Presidency?
Wow more stupid right wing bull shit in a stupid bullshit right wing sub filled with nothing but right wing jizzrags.
"Playing poker, enjoying life, and shaking my head at the folks caught up in political theatre."
"Wait.... that's all I hear about in here. This sub digs into left issues. Isn't it fair someone else digs into right issues?

Is the world suppose to ignore mistakes made by the right? Just checking."
The whataboutism is strong today I see
It's pretty funny that right wing social media posters think bringing up ghislaine maxwell is owning the left
"The answers to these are obvious:

*literally never stopped talking about it since epstein died.*"
"We were too busy pointing out all of the illegal & corrupt shit trump, his family and cronies were doing. That kept everyone pretty busy."
Agree with this.  But don't you think trumps presidency should be mentioned?
"While it's overblown and some groups are def attacking Joe due to political reasons, he does make it easy by being such a dumbass.  But how does the Maxwell or Smollet cases have anything to do with this, they were prosecuted and found guilty, why would some continue outrage when those 2 received some form of justice?"
"Joe Rogan painted a giant target on himself. He refused to apologize and painted an even bigger Target on his back. Wrong or right he chased this. 

It's also very easy to write something that uses popular python libraries to rip every mp3 or MP4 from YouTube of his show and convert to timestamped searchable text documents? Hell, there may already be transcripts out there. 

It's trivially easy to do and viral fame and ad revenue are huge motivators in the gig economy."
"I've heard of this! It's called the ""whataboutism"" defense strategy!!"
Reading about every one of those bullet points from multiple sources with absolute ease?
Classic.  Don't look here - look over there!  GTFO.
You don't need to pick through an entire pile of shit to know that its shit
Censoring podcasts is the equivalent to burning books.
"And the Canadian government stealing money, heat sources, fuel and made it illegal to help a worker revolt. Are now talking about using the military to cull a worker revolt. While state funded media pumps out propaganda about them on the airwaves. 

All under a leader that has repeated said he admires chinas ‚Äúbasic dictatorship‚Äù. He took the communist dad thing a little too far."
"I was here...
And often listening to JRE ü§∑"
"SS : the left is upset with what Joe rogan said, they are upset  because he destroyed their narrative. And if you truly are upset, why aren't you mad at Whoopi?

We have been distracted & divided by all these nonsense things so that we don't look at the Bigger picture."
[deleted]
The mainstream media can analyze millions of words of what Joe Rogan said over his entire life but not what one word of what Dr. Malone said in a single podcast.
The joe rogan hysteria is a coordinated political hit with for the purpose of getting rid of him before the midterms.
When ole joe is called out now the other side is finally wondering about sex scandals. Deflecting. Thats the real conspiracy...
"They were too busy combing through Trump's tweets, obviously."
"This is just republican horseshit trying to tie epstein/Maxwell to the opposition. Smollett is a celebrity scandal, like the CNN shit, and they're nowhere near as significant as the Maxwell trial or the epstein murder. The pandemic Trump bungled is not the same as ""all that stuff that Biden did that I don't like""."
"It's easier for people to feel like ""part of the solution"" when they let others guide them to their decisions."
Sorry ur god turned out to be racist
"You are asking  reddit where most participants wanted the pandemic to happen.

Or is that someone asking on twitter."
"Uhhh people were posting on social media about those things too. Until it no longer brought them clout in which case they moved on to the next thing. Which is exactly what will happen with Rogan too. No one really gives a shit about anything, they just want to seem like they do."
‚Ä¶.. being unemployed listening to joe rogan
"They intentionally ignored the facts, just like with their malicious reporting on Kyle Rittenhouse."
Or trump and his treasonous insurrection?
"Pretty sure most people talked about all of these things, but one half of the population never hears about it because they live in a facebook/fox/OAN information dead zone.

We gonna talk about Trump and Epstein raping that 13 year old girl and then threatening her family?"
"<Crickets chirping>

It's almost as if this latest outrage is petty and completely manufactured. Imagine that."
This guy is so invited to my carne asada someone let him know. He's got the invite.
"Whoa, he got everyone with that whataboutism."
Literally deflection
Seriously WTF?  This is getting beyond insane. Not what CNN is doing. But we just idly allow it.
upvote 669 weeee
Lost me at ‚Äúpandemic‚Äù.
NY/NJ had more LTC facility murders than the PA/MI nursing home genocide. Cuomo and Murphy are some historic serial killers.
Ah Juicey Small A.
Can't I just feel like they all suck?
But he said the n word!
100%
nobody was disputing this stuff though lol
You forgot to mention the Fox News sex scandals. Was that deliberate or just selective amnesia?
Selective outrage.
Everyone knows Rogan has powerful people telling him there's shit he can't say/do . U think they would let him? LOL
"Because nobody cares about any of that.

The world is oversaturated with bad scary news, so people had to get numb to it.

The only thing that moves the needle in terms of average people caring, is entertainment related news.  Rogan is entertainment so people care."
These aren't mutually exclusive. We can be upset about multiple things.
jeez...no shit right?  these damn people
Shhhh please fall for the distraction while ignoring the real issues
"Lol so true. They combed through 3,000 hours... Probably had 200 people working on it."
They all have Podcast?
"If those are the things you're using as examples of real conspiracies, you're probably just copying/pasting this from someone else who has even less imagination (and education) than you do."
It's a $hit Show.
Don't you know that those with a (D) next to their names can do no wrong?
Add Hunter‚Äôs laptop.
The media didn't point them in *those* directions
NY genocides as well
selective manufactured outrage
On the plus side spotify still has al jolson fans covered. Some of the album covers on there even have him in his signature blackface lol
Jussie Smollet really doesn't fit in with all the other points here.
Lmao OP posts about government corruption and international child sex trafficking by the global elite and the top comments are about Trump.
Because people have been conditioned to feel outrage. Any reporter that seeks more information is going to be told that there‚Äôs no story here. Bosses get wind of it and threaten their livelihood for even pursuing that avenue. Joe Rogan is being manufactured as a controversial figure that talks about  dangerous misinformation. People are still in panic pandemic mode and don‚Äôt know what rational is so they see a person spreading misinformation as being most dangerous. People are foolish. If I have a podcast that has 300 viewers and I‚Äôm doing exactly as Rogan has no one is batting an eye.
Ch ch cherry picking piece of !
"It's a smear campaign because Joe is against the AI vaxine.

The irony is joe used those terms with out hate though immaturely and they revile against him in hate and unforgivingly so.

It's all a set up since he's spreading more truth and they are all cover up artists afraid of it bing exposed like vampires to the sunlight."
"Will you shut up man?

I'd say more but my butts been wiped"
house
Whataboutism at it's very best
Didn‚Äôt we just send troops to Uzbekistan or some shit?
This sub is one of the last places on reddit where you can see and speak truth. Almost everything else is corrupt beyond reason.
"The classic ""nobody is talking about this"" when you can find people talking about practically everywhere."
Clearly they supported those topics.
I'm to distracted over the fact the guy looks like Jared Fogel.
"Who said Joe Rogan, you have my full attention."
"Locked in their houses, collecting extra unemployment, binged out on Tiger King, and getting fatter from Grub Hub Deliveries.... 

Oh!

Also, memeing the 2020 President Elections."
"Actually those things were also pointed out, specifically Biden‚Äôs political career. Maybe the media didn‚Äôt point it out but a lot of people online did."
Only 1 of the things in that list even means anything. Alex Jones made the original compilation video suck on that for a while
What are the nursing home genocides?
Read 1984 and you'll understand.
Where were you when trump attempted to steal the election?
"Yea the media picks and chooses who they like, As a black man that has listens to Joe for years on the radio and podcast, yea he says some crazy things, but he also gives good life advice & he‚Äôs been through so much in his own life, making mistakes is part of healing. I don‚Äôt understand why this society thinks hate is better than forgiveness ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
"Joe Rogan has all the sweaty young white men he can handle in one lifetime  Naked, fatherless and covered in baby oil."
Or the biggest con of them all: the 40 hour work week with time ‚Äúrequests‚Äù.
Free Julian Asanje
"um, I was in facebook jail"
Jan 6 insurrection?
I'm just waiting for Trump to get indicted.
I feel as though all of those have been combed too
We‚Äôre not capable of looking at more than one issue at a time?
I have been here the whole time knowing what is going to happen and noone listens to me.
"IS SHE STILL ON TRIAL???
HAS RANDY ANDY TURNED UP YET???
ü§£‚úåüëäüëçüëÜ‚úå"
It‚Äôs almost like people who don‚Äôt watch Joe Rogan will believe anything negative said about him
Anyone else watching the down and up vote war?
That‚Äôs not a conspiracy
"Oh look here‚Äôs his buddy AJ calling out the same shit when he was beefing with him 

https://mobile.twitter.com/i/status/1490552283838521350"
"1.) Remember when Trump **[wished Maxwell well?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC2jsRrzCrs)**

2.) No one's defending Jussie Smollett - not sure why you guys are so obsessed with this

3.) CNN sex scandals? What about them? And **[have you guys heard about Roger Ailes?](https://www.vox.com/2016/8/15/12416662/roger-ailes-fox-sexual-harassment-women-list)**

4.) I sincerely doubt anyone's committing genocide in nursing homes. This is just more Sarah Palin-esque ""death panel"" crap rearing its ugly head again.

5.) Biden's entire political career? What about it? And what's he doing right now that's so horrible? Also - this sub publicly bobbed Trumo's knob for six years now....are you aware of **his** record?

6.) What about this pandemic? The fact that the virus exists and wasn't a hoax like Trump said it was? That vaccines are the most sensible solution to preventing hospitalization, beating out Hydroxlchlorquine, horse paste and disinfectant injections (suggested by disgraced former President Trump) by a mile?"
Don't forget the NY nursing home genocide.
"This 100,000 times over!"
üíØ
and the NY nursing home genocides...
add the MA veterans home mass deaths
Would love to be more informed on the MI nursing home thing
Derp
"truth doesn't matter anymore, reality is meaningless, only big brother matters now"
"Isn't it weird after Shang-chi came out that you never hear about Asian hate crimes in the news anymore, almost like leading up to the premier there was a reverse psychology media event promoting Asian hate so people would think I'm not racist so I'll support this Asian lead movie by going to go see it"
No f*****g shit! I am sick of hearing this crap about Joe Rogan. Where is the list of people who don't want their names released that were on Epstein's Island?
