"“Balanced reporting” doesn’t mean both sides of an argument deserve equal merit. One side can indeed be factually correct while the other is just plain wrong. We’re talking about facts, not opinions."
"That's the tragedy of or species.  That we live at a time where we have immediate access to everything we have learned, written, or recorded since those first crude markings on cave walls.  It's there.  Everything we have learned.   And what do people do with it?  Jerk off and convince each other the Earth is flat.  

We should be embarrassed, really.  For what we have allowed ourselves to become."
Balanced reporting should only include facts.
If reporting was balanced you would have 49 scientists who believe in climate change on TV for every 1 that doesn't.
"We need a clear distinction in our news between opinion and fact. 

It is ok to report on opinion, but it us not OK to present opinion as indistinguishable from objective fact.

Colbert's truthiness is too powerful. America doesn't care about facts, but we just accept repetition of lies as truth, if we hear the lies enough."
Science never makes something ‘incontrovertibly disproven.’  It only gives us better questions.
"Well, the unfortunate reality that I think many in here realize is the truth doesn't really matter to some in power. The only thing that matters is more money and more power.  If everyone universally realized what was true, what our impact was on climate change. The economy as we know it would not function, it would not grow, you would not have more wealth generation. That's literally all these people care about. Humans have a very long tradition of building and taking and exploiting until they can't"
"Everyone needs to watch the new BBC documentary, Big Oil v the World. I knew there was a lot of disinformation, misinformation and malinformation from the likes of Exxon, Koch brothers, but the stuff that has gone on is another level altogether.

1. The article references [this study](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2022-40596-001) which does not study public opinion on climate change across US, it studies whether public opinion *can* be shifted using incorrect media representation. It does not make any statements about current views about climate in US. Referencing this study is manipulation.
2. The article makes ungrounded claims that *""many Americans believe that the global crisis is either not real, not of our making, or both""*. [The](https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/publications/a-growing-majority-of-americans-think-global-warming-is-happening-and-are-worried/) study from Yale University shows a different picture, 70% of public in US are onboard with science when it comes to the climate change.

**TL;DR.** Article title is misleading at best. It says ""many"" when actually it's a minority who does not believe in science around climate change. Article also makes ungrounded (and emotionally loaded) claims. **70% of public in US actually support scientifically based views of climate change.**"

"This is not the problem you think it is.

Switching to renewables makes sense *without* global warming because fossil fuels are a FINITE resource.

We are going to run out of fossil fuels at some point (10, 100, 1000 years) because the consumption is outpacing the production. We will have to switch to renewables at some point no matter what, and doing it sooner rather than later 'might' save the planet."

"I don't understand why it even matters if climate change is caused by us or not. I mean it clearly is, but its so strange to me that *that* continues to be the center of the issue for so many. Why is the idea of making changes to better our world and make it a more comfortable place to live met with such vitriol from the right?"
"One of the more pernicious arguments I now hear against human induced climate change is the notion that CO2 only accounts for ~0.04% of the atmosphere and human activities account for only 3% of that.

The reason this is so pernicious is that it’s masked as a scientific argument against human induced climate change as for the average person these numbers equate to essentially rounding error in most settings they may find themselves.

What it fails to reflect is there’s delicate physical constants governing nature that if even had the slightest perturbation would result in dramatic changes to the universe — in many cases ending life as we know it."

"If we are going to be intellectually honest here, it’d be best if we all began to realize that even if everyone in the Western civilization realized that man was the cause of global warming, there would still be nothing we could do about it. We’d only really be able to slow it down.

What we really need to do is prepare for it. Let’s accept that the planet is going to get unbearably warmer. So we need to figure out nuclear fission and really efficient ways to get water from the ocean. We need to pump water to the forests and crops and fields and we need to build a solar reflector in space that redirects 1 % of the sun light to the earth (cooling us off some nearly 3 degrees F)"
Actually it hasn’t. Your interpretation of science has.
"Why people dont believe in man made climate change?

Because most powerful people in the world are buying sea side properties, fly their private jets for short trips, buy third and fourth mansion. and then lecture us that a regular Joe is guilty of climate change and that regular Joe must sacrifice everything or else…"
Bill Nye said something like if you wanted to have a fair and balanced discussion of climate change you'd give scientists 59:58 of air time and deniers 2 seconds. because that's the proportions of observation and research to plausible deniability.
"I have come to believe there's no actual new media companies they have all been converted into speakers and representatives of their billionaire owners.

I went to check out Huffington Post while back for 1st time in many years. They entire first page was links to crap about Amazon Prime Day Deals. They used to report actual news events and report on some interesting off the wall incidents.

Anyone with intact reasoning skills knows Fox is just  manipulation attempts packaged for the masses.

Look to the owners they speak for their interests no one else."
"It is not about ""balanced"" reporting. The problem is the reporting is trying to be fair to the other side of the issue, even thought the other side is not actually credible. This false balance leads people to believe that the other side has a great deal more validity than it actually does, and that the difference in evidence between them is a lot less than is actually the case."
"It's not just science that has disproven it, nearly every fossil fuel company in the industry has admitted that it's happening, that CO2 is causing it, and a couple of them even admitted that they not only knew about it but covered it up for several decades.

Regardless, the population has ignored these admissions and continues to claim it's a scam / cover up / conspiracy.

I'm not sure why they think a fossil fuel company would admit to having covered up the information, if they actually hadn't."
"Maybe the problem is the leaders of this movement also fly in private jets, etc. That’s incontrovertibly proven."
"It is not in the name of balance reporting. It is all about monied interests preserving the status quo to preserve their profit stream. Media consolidation in the last 50 years has resulted in such a total corporate control of information sources, but we really only hear what they want us to hear."
Giving the fringe a voice is not balanced reporting. The consensus is what should be reported.
"The study did not say that the theory that climate change is not man made has been incontrovertibly disproven by science. 

Science is not a tool which is capable of ""proving"" or ""disproving"" anything, only gathering more or less evidence for a certain hypothesis. 

While I understand the sentiment, pretending that the scientific method is capable of ""proving"" any hypothesis is both dishonest and only leads to further division and polarization of groups."
"Climate change is *not* man-made (anthropogenic), it's being *accelerated* by human activity. That distinction is incredibly important, and if we're to post here as a scientific community we should respect that.

There should always be room for people to challenge ""established scientific facts"" because that's what science is, otherwise we're just looking at dogmatic reality dictation. That said, for something to be taken seriously, we should expect a level of professionalism and provision of credible/replicable evidence, and not facebook memes."
"> The argument that climate change is not man made has been incontrovertibly disproven by science again and again..  
  
or  
> Climate change is a great case study of the false balance problem, because the scientific consensus is nearly unanimous.  
  
If it was incontrovertible, the connsensus would be unanimous, not 'nearly unanimous'. That's what incontrovertible means.  
  
The problem here is the expectation that there's a simple black/white answer which we all should accept unquestioningly. But that's not what science is about. Science doesn't have 'truths', it has currently preferred theorems. But those theorems must always be open to being questioned, or science will stagnate.  
  
As it happens I strongly believe that climate change is real and has been massively exacerbated by man-made CO2 (and other greenhouse gas) emissions. But I'll bet my pension that the details will be refined in coming years. Adopting the approach which this paper suggests would make that less likely or impossible."

"Science does not prove anything.

Science only supplies evidence.

Proofs are left for the math department.

  


And it is this fundamental misunderstanding of science which causes people to ignore this."
"Fundamental flaw:  Nothing in Science is ever PROVEN, it’s only hypotheses that have FAILED TO BE DISPROVEN.  

If you don’t understand the difference, up your Science game."
"""The argument that climate change is not man made has been incontrovertibly disproven by science""

Well, I am not sure I agree with this statement. I think that it has been proven that man made activities significantly contributed to the global warming, along with other geological and cosmic factors. 

Global warming has been heavily used as a political tool, which adds to distrust and denial. Many people do not have the educational background  to understand scientific data and reasoning and instead gobble up political narratives."
"The sentiment of this post scares me more than any climate change claim ever will. Arguing against the free expression of ideas is infinitely more dangerous than contributing to supposedly ""unbalanced"" discussion."
"Claiming things are proven ""by science"" is detrimental to the cause.


Smoking was healthy as said ""by the science""


Thalidomide (not in the US, I know) is good by ""the science""

Where does the list end? You'll never ever win the public over by claiming ""the science"" says it's correct. As soon as ""the science"" realised it could make money, it lost any credibility with the public.

Yes there's an obedient mass who will lap it up, but there's a huge score of rational people who have been fed lies by governments for decades who just can't believe the stuff told to them.


You've made your bed, now we all lie in it.

Maybe, just maybe, governments shouldnt have lied to their populations for decades and suddenly expect sympathy and apathy from them."
Scientific proof is like a court case. You can provide incontrovertible proof but some people will jury nullification it. But by some people I mean a whole lot of people.
"I tend to ascribe to the idea that climate change is both always occurring (whether humans are involved or no), and that both are happening at the same time,.of course. 

There can be both natural climate change. As we have seen over millennia, as well as man mande climate change. Which j have no doubt is contributing to the highest highs and the lowest lows we have seen in (relatively) recent years. 

I don't understand why people cannot see both as a truth. But even moreso, I cannot understand the people who vehemently deny any man-made climate change when we are pumping soamy pollutants into the atmosphere where there were none before our age (that we know of). It is just mind boggling."
"Balanced reporting is so much horseshit...

&#x200B;

I like that explanation of journalism:

When someone says it rains outside and someone else says it isn't, your job is not to cite them both.

Your job is to fuckin check if it rains outside."
"They were told by one side that they were killing the planet and ruining it for future generations. All true and a normal person realizing that they were contributing to something of that magnitude would work to undo the damage they'd caused. Example, the hole in the ozone layer. Last I heard it's on track to being repaired soon-ish. Twas a big hole.

The other side said it was a concentrated effort to scare them into by expensive and worse performing products and is enabled by the left as an active effort to make them poorer. And tbf, early iterations of products sucked. Low flow toilets were the worst. I remember a news story when I was younger talking about one version of energy efficient bulbs containing mercury and if the bulb broke, you'd need a hazmat team to come clean the house. Was probably fox.

But first iterations always suck. It's hard to engineer a theoretical concept into reality. Nowadays, least round here and it's a deep red state, appliances have to have an efficiency rating and needs to exceed certain benchmarks, energy efficient water heaters or using solar to heat the water and the tank maintains as necessary. Light bulbs are better. Low flow toilets don't suck. 

And, again in my area, a deep sea of GOP, we've recycled so much and so efficiently that the private companies went bust. Paper and cardboard now  ""provide negative returns"" with glass, plastics, and other stuff reaching that point. Only aluminum, rubber, and e-waste make any money and nobody around here recycles rubber or e-waste. 

It's a little like vaccines in that it's a victim of it's own success. Efficient products are the standard for a lot of things and there's been 30 years of successful recycling campaigns. The vast majority of our pollution problems are because of corporate entities just paying fines as a matter of business as doing it correctly is more expensive. Meanwhile, the right has hammered on about climate change being fake for three decades, telling people it's not their fault bad things are happening. Sometimes forests burn. It gets hot in the summer. And so on.

The right also likes to push the narrative that none of the gloom and doom predicted like the East Coast being overwhelmed by the rising Atlantic Ocean. And all that scary talk about acid rain leaving the environment in ruins, causing mass famine and misery. Which didn't happen because we took action....again a victim of success.

Nowadays, it's just a torrent of the ""left has been lying for decades"". ""The left wants you to sit in the dark, miserable, without electricity or heating/cooling so the 'liberal elites' can retire to their gated communities and do everything that they've asked us to give up."". ""It's not a plan to help with climate change, it's to destroy our 'prosperity' and economy. And neither China nor India will honor any agreement that gets in their way, so why should we sacrifice our prosperity?"".

Constant spewing of sewage. People are told they're victims of a conspiracy from China and India that has already suckered Europe and Canada and that the left are in league against the American people. They're told that none of the predictions from decades ago have panned out (yes they have!), we're not starving and ruined from acid rain. It's a plot to destroy your home, your country, that's aided and spread by liberals because socialist-lite policies = communism. So vote GOP to preserve your way of life and your country!

And it works extremely well. It makes the deniers into victims, feeds them xenophobia and distrust of experts and liberals, and makes it an emotional response instead of an intellectual based response. There is nuance and grey areas in climate change. ""You and your country are directly under attack!"" is not an intellectual response. It's a primal, deep-seated fear. And that overrides everything else because it's survival. There's not time to think."

"Have we proven that fluctuations in sun radiance intensity is not a factor? I'd want to correct for all possible causes to ensure appropriate accounting for each cause.  Can we say without a shadow of a doubt that humans are the only cause? Are humans 80% of the rise in temperature, 60%, 10%?"
"Why wouldn't they? It's not a dictatorship and decenting scientific opinions are the backbone of progress. If not we would all be forced into using DC current for everything. 
Science is disputed every day and great things happen. It needs a voice. 

It's pretty obvious humans have a negative impact to global warming but do we know how mother nature corrects itself or finds balance in a thousand year or million year cycle? For humankind's survival, I hope we can find better solutions for efficient energy generation that we can all buy into by demand not dictatorship."

""Do you think I don't understand what my friend, the Professor, long ago called the hydrostatic paradox of controversy? Don't know what it means? - Well, I will tell you. You know, that, if you had a bent tube, one arm of which was of the size of a pipe-stem, and the other big enough to hold the ocean, water would stand at the same height in one as in the other. Controversy equalizes fools and wise men in the same way, — and the fools know it."""
"Completely ignore the physics of atmospheric CO2 for a second. 

Just look at this [graph](https://assets.weforum.org/editor/IXOp1xthuSDlPNBqPb-hJzkVY2yeQTptx6Bt5tFGTJ4.PNG) and tell me what the odds are that global temperatures just so happened to explosively raise while corresponding almost perfectly with the Industrial Revolution? 

It is factual that throughout the ages of this planet, it has been both much hotter and with much more CO2 than present, while also much colder and with considerably less CO2 (we’re in a cycle of stadial / interstadial - an “ice age” and a temporary warming inbetween since the Pleistocene). 

Except we’ve hijacked that natural variation and effected change at a pace that is unprecedented in the geologic record. 

Other “fast” changes of climate state occurred after severe, acute events such as large meteor impacts or flood basalt eruptions; the latter still taking place over thousands, tens of thousands, and hundreds of thousands of years."
"This is because media is owned by so few people who use it to support the political parties. The parties use the media just like they use social platforms, to divide the people.

That's all they care about."
"Except that when 99 scientists claim A, and 1 scientist claims B, the moment you start giving equal voicing, you are not doing a balanced reporting.

"The idea of balanced reporting in regards to certain subjects is infuriating.

I once saw a clip of a BBC interview with an expert on vaccines. One of the comments on it was someone saying ""we need someone at the same level of expertise who has the opposite viewpoint because this is one sided.""

99.99% of the people who have the same level of expertise as that person won't have an opposing viewpoint because they've seen the data and know which side is the right one. That's how science works!"
Reddit is littered with insanely delusional climate crisis denialists. There are dozen right here in this thread already.
Many Republicans/Trumpers… not many Americans just them..
Same in the UK. Stream of decorated scientists one after another and then Nigel Lawson wheeled out. A man with little grasp over how to tie his shoelaces never mind global heating.
“Balanced Reporting” is not why climate deniers are doing it
"As long as lawmakers and leaders won’t acknowledge the profound damage that corporate news platforms and unregulated social media causes society, none of this will become any better. What’s maybe even worse is that people and groups who spread “alternative truths”, seem to believe that freedom of speech also means freedom of responsibility. And so far it seems like they’re right — I highly doubt that FoxNews will face any consequences for its role as loyal mouthpiece during (and after) the former president’s attempted coup d’état. And let’s face it, if that is not prosecutable, what is?"
There are not two sides to everything. There are facts and not facts.
I know a few conservatives who believe climate change is fake. I don't know what can be done about them anymore. they are too far gone down the rabbit hole of propaganda.
I think it’s real but the solutions I hear are batshit crazy.
"So I am 100% asking in good faith as it seems really hard to find bias in articles about climate change.

What is the actual accepted consensus on CC?

Is it that humans have caused 100% of climate change and there's no chance that the earth would have ever warmed this rapidly Or is it more like we fucked up and added so much co2 to an already warming planet? Then on top of it were not doing enough to alleviate it?

I know science is really never black and white, but is it here?

What's a good factual scientific resource on this? It's been so politicized its hard to find hard data on it (for me at least) when it should be science fact not opinion."
