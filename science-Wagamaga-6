"I’m a physician and I don’t like this reporting at all. It invites a financial justification of everything we do. Next, some bean counter right will point out that the surviving Medicare recipients will cost many more billions because they didn’t die during the epidemic. We try to save lives because it’s the right thing to do, not because it’s cost-effective."
The fact that it cost an average of ~$15000 to treat covid if you did get hospitalized in the US is also a problem.  (Just did the math quick on all 1.03m folks mentioned would have gone to the hospital)

Yep. Just as I expected. It's a graveyard in here.

Serious question but how do you get these kinds of numbers? How would you know it prevented potential deaths? How is it that their able to have these numbers of lives saved coorelated to the vaccine but at the same time a lot of reports of side effects are usually unknown and not linked to the vaccination.

The insurance companies saved billions but they’re still raising my rates next year by almost 10%.
See lots of conspiracy theorist think higher powers want people to die from a vaccine.  Nah that takes people from the work force and rich folks don’t want to work themselves.
How is it earthly possible to predict whether these people would’ve died or not?

So if you got covid after being vaccinated and didn’t die it means the vaccine is why you didn’t die? Is that the reasoning here?
Because they are safe and effective.
How many trillions did the pharmaceutical companies get?

"> In addition to the reductions in severe COVID-19 health outcomes, reductions in COVID-19 hospitalizations were associated with savings of more than $16 billion in direct medical costs.

I'm not sure that's the best angle to try to contextualize this, [considering](https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/forefront.20210512.191448/);

> Recent estimates from the Congressional Research Service, the Government Accountability Office, and Chad Brown and Thomas Bollyky along with data on the GHIAA.org and Devex websites provide government spending estimates of between $18 billion and $23 billion. Most recently the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the Biomedical Research and Development Authority (BARDA) alone has spent $19.3 billion on COVID-19 vaccine development. In addition, Lisa Cornish projected $39.5 billion in US spending."

"How do they know that the vaccines directly impacted life or death? Is there some way to tell if someone survived because of it? Or is there someway to tell that if they had the vaccine they were 100% going to live?

Or is it mathematically figured that because of the vaccine the probability of extreme medical treatment is lower so therefore you can extract what said probable medical costs would be and subtract that from Medicare costs? 

Just curious because this is great info to share."

We only printed 10 trillion dollars… look at the 16billion we saved!!!

"Covid vaccines prevented at least 330,000 deaths and nearly 700,000 hospitalizations among adult Medicare recipients in 2021, the Health and Human Services Department said in a new report published Friday.

The reduction in hospitalizations due to vaccination saved more than $16 billion in medical costs, according to the HHS report. A 10% increase in vaccination coverage was associated with a 12% and 15% decline in the chances of hospitalization and death, respectively, among adult Medicare recipients, according to the study.


The HHS study looked at county-level data on vaccination rates and changes in hospitalization and death among a sample of Medicare beneficiaries ages 18 and older. Texas and Hawaii were not included in the study due to incomplete vaccination data.

"I have never read such a propaganda filled article in my life that is disguised as a reputable study. Did they really have to credit the Biden Administration 3 times in 3 paragraphs? This is the NHS doing this work, not a unique accomplishment that another administration wouldn’t have pursued. 
Also, how are they proving that vaccines caused the reduction in deaths? We have all learned that the subsequent strains became less deadly upon infection, so this is not an apples-to-apples comparison. I still can’t believe that people take these studies at face value. This is why we need more Americans to study science, statistics, and be educated on challenging scientific articles."

Spend 5 trillion putting America on a fitness and health plan instead. I bet you save more people and actually save our medical costs."
