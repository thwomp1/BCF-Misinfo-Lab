"Won't investigate murders of their own citizens, but will hunt people all around the globe for decades if they expose illegal actions commited by government/military bcs ""national security"""
"Apparently she exposed the president of turkey of knowingly allowing isis fighters to travel into Syria in trucks labeled as non government organizations, such as health and food organizations. She even stated she was afraid of the Turkish governments response as they are known in the journalism community as being ""the world's largest prison for journalist""  according to The Gaurdian."
And that my friends is why no one does real journalism any more.
"^(<-- How's picture is this?)

**The US is refusing to investigate the murder of its citizens by its own allies??? How shocking...**"
"[Add her to the list](https://cpj.org/reports/2020/12/murders-journalists-more-than-doubled-killed/)

>Globally, at least 30 journalists were killed in 2020; 21 of those were singled out for murder in retaliation for their work,"
"I don‚Äôt doubt this, because the government isn‚Äôt for us. They‚Äôre against us."
How many people like her are there? Really? Like Jesus Christ this happens way too often
Keshogi anyone?
"More to the story. 

Usually when a country fails, somebody, NATO, the UN, the Americans, the British, Whoever. But somebody from the international community gets over there and secures the heavy weapons and artillery. You don't want a bunch of missiles capable of blowing commercial aircraft out of the sky falling into the wrong hands. 

Except when the CIA ousted Quadaffi. That stuff just disappeared, and re-appeared in the hands of ""revolutionary forces"" in Syria, where Hillary was trying to topple Assad.

To get there it had to move through Turkey, where this young lady reported seeing it being transported, and hours later she was killed."
Pretty sure she was murdered by the CIA.
Reminder that Turkey assaulted American Protesters on American Soil and our president did nothing.
Does anyone have a link to this live broadcast?
Don't even mention the Saudi's and the journalist they killed.
"Why would they investigate?! It‚Äôs America who‚Äôs quietly orchestrating the whole thing from behind the scenes.

I don‚Äôt know what type of journalism she‚Äôs doing but a quick google search would have told her that the weapons supply to Turkey comes from the USA"
"Does the US govt frequently investigate the deaths of their citizens abroad?

Like I'm not trying to downplay what happened, but is their refusal something out of the ordinary?"
[deleted]
There's official narrative and then there's Nazis.
foreign government doesn‚Äôt handle auto accidents.
The United States was / is directly funding isis. Why would the criminals investigate themselves.
That is because John McCain was running ISIS.
"The CIA under Obama created ISIS. Do people really not understand this yet? Wake tf up, sheep."
"SS: In 2014, Serena Shim was an american citizen working as a journalist in syria . Exposed the turkish government aiding isis on live television . 2 days later she was killed in a car accident , and US Govt refused to investigate her death."
the us gov is complicit in war crimes and espionage all over the world. America is the new hydra hub.
"I used to follow ‚ÄúLions of Rojava‚Äù on Facebook during the Syrian civil war!

They were Syrian Kurds and fought valiantly against the tyranny of ISIS!!

But the Turks had a pop at them afterwards! Nobody came to help the Kurds, which was a real
shame!

I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised at all if the Turks aided ISIS on the side!"
"The powerful go after the truth tellers, not the liars."
I was against Turkey as soon as I read up on the Kurdish genocide. Fuck Turkey. They aid ISIS so they can fight the Kurds in the mountains on two fronts because a money backed military with state of the art equipment can't handle a bunch of refugees with AKs on their own. Also they tried to cover up Jamal Khashoggi's death after he was killed.
"Was she vaxxed, though?"
"Interesting how this post comes up when Turkey makes the decision to allow those other two countries to join NATO...

Say hi to Putin for me, and let him know to go fuckhimself and stop blowing up malls."
"""Accident ""."
Turkey must‚Äôve removed from NATO
she cute
I didn‚Äôt go to Syria. I didn‚Äôt die. See how that works?
"We (trump) also abandoned our allies to be slaughtered there, and Biden did the same in Afghanistan."
"Do you know how many are there Turkic tribe around ME, Asia and Caucaisa?
Turkey always accept they are helping Turkmen in Syria. You show look they are Isis, but they are Turkmen.
And fuck your Putin love. They bombed Turkmen villages in Syria. You got what you wish.Keep wanking Putin's pictures.You know he is a narcissist."
"At one point she was also several hundred kilometers in size and hovered over the Middle East, as pictured here, yet was not spotted by anyone. Did Rick Sanchez create yet another anatomy theme park?"
What a gorgeous Woman.
Cringe
From the grave
Free Ricky Vaughn
The life expectancy of good journalists seems ‚Äúsuspiciously‚Äù low.
"I really am curious if anyone has a long list of Journalists that died in suspicious circumstances, like the journalist who exposed the Panama papers and died in a car bomb in Malta."
Damn may her soul Rest In Peace.
Well who do you think was giving the Turkish government the money to give ISIS?  Duhhh
Hallelujah a real conspiracy. I haven‚Äôt heard about this.
"I know all about her.  I wrote articles about Serena Shim.   This raises big questions about why Turkey is in NATO.  

This conversation is 3rd rail today due to Ukraine."
Turkey is using Nato to remove the shias and become the most prominent power in sunni Islam. They want to reestablish the ottoman sultanate.
"An accident, of course"
Or should Americans stay in America üôÑ
Unalived
Reminds me of Rachel Corrie for some reason.
hi my name is johnny Knoxville welcome to jackass
Hmmm.
"Hi sorry if I am confused, but you look pretty healthy for being ‚Äúkilled‚Äù in a ‚Äúcar accident‚Äù"
US government is SHIT
Im Turkish and I didn‚Äôt know that. What a fucked up country I‚Äôve born.
And she‚Äôs hot.   Terrible  but at least she was not raped and tortured  like those savages typically do. ISIS take ignorant people and turns them into monsters.    Taliban to  and the CIA. Have them all those weapons and gear when we left Afghanistan.   I tell you what  sometime I just shake my head with wonder when I see what goes on
If she‚Äôs dead how is she speaking to me through this picture
What did the video show?
"No surprise, Erdogan family had ties to trade stolen ISIS Oil, they made billions with that, never asked how Erdogan got billionaere?

Isn't it weird how people who have damning information just happen to commit suicide or die in some totally random accident.
"Its about all being a big plot, moving parts that justify taxes, u see an armay that wont move to protect its country so you make a war, small one but just enough to send troops to countries with no factual evidence of it being a menace. 

Its a ""bigger organization"", even if we try to take back this world from the politics that destroyed them, which we wont cause we cant, its all a bigger plot from them to end this in chaos and war. 

Fear is their tool, and we keep giving it to them, fear of loosing all we have achieved, fear of being spotted."
"It's weird that when searching just by her name there's not a single mayor news network in the results but lots of independent publications.

I can't even remember hearing about this."
Currption is everywhere.... that is why Bolsonaro is having the fight of fights... We are fighting the new world order. He swims between communists and new age adepty. Dude. Traps everywhere. We must watch our steps.
"Yeah, because ISIS was a CIA created organization with the sole purpose of existing to cripple Russia's economy by undercutting their oil sales to Europe. Obama beat them economically using the Middle East War as cover. 

Obama perpetuated the Bush eta war machine...just used non Americans also...

Nevermind, can't have actual conspiracies around here."
This what this sub is for.
She was on the side of Kurdish terrorists
She‚Äôs blond and beautiful I‚Äôm surprised there isn‚Äôt more outrage
As always did the Us govt
