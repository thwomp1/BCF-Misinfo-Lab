"The legal system exists for the rich, evil and corrupt."
"Whenever I see stuff like this, I wonder if people remember you can be mad at more than one thing. Two things can be bad."
"SS: Ghislaine Maxwell found guilty but judge orders all details on Epstein's Network to be sealed. In summary: It's worse than all the ""conspiracy theories"".
And the media talks about Rogan since omicron is not affecting the masses anymore due to diminishing returns of fear.

It's all big club and we ain't in it."
there's more outrage over Ghislaine than umm.... uhhh... aids awareness. Also how come we only ever had 1 Live Aids concert??? a bit concerning I think.
Have you guys ever heard of multitasking?
"And yet almost all the posts on this ‚Äúconspiracy‚Äù subreddit are about vaccines bad, truck driver good. If your podcast boyfriend said a bunch of racist shit, and then there was blowback from that, then maybe he‚Äôs not good for whatever you think your cause is."
"Oh, you again.  Sweet twitter grab bruh.  Much conspiracy."
"Not just the media, this sub happily did it to itself. How many Joe Rogan posts have there been lately? Seems that other than the truckers it‚Äôs been the dominant theme here.

The Media isn‚Äôt forcing people to make those posts, it‚Äôs not forcing people to upvote the. This sub can blame the media all it wants, but it just did the exact same thing.

Why would the media bother to cover Maxwell over Rogan when literal conspiracy theorists who have been raging about Eppstein for the past couple years care more about Rogan than Maxwell??

The media may be shit but at the end of the day it‚Äôs TV and it shows viewers what they want to see. If even this sub can‚Äôt pay attention to Maxwell, there no way the media is going to."
Control the narrative and you will control what people think.
"And virtually no discussion of the connections between Maxwell, Epstein and Trump

But the media will keep whining about Rogan being ""cancelled"" while still raking in millions"
Why do we keep upvoting posts that are just repeats of posts from like 12 hours prior?
Yeah except this post is more to defend Joe. No one has forgotten about Maxwell or Epstein.
But a white guy said the n word
"There was more talk of the monkeys that escaped in PA than the multiple UFO sightings in the same area at the same time, or the missile that caused a volcanic eruption and global shockwave the likes of which we've never recorded. (or the big earthquake that was ""edited"" off the records)"
"It's been less than a year. You can't just grab people and put them on trial without a case. Maxwell just saying it was this person is not a trial. 

Think how long it took to bring her to trial when it was known what was going on. 

Need to do it correctly, with a trial and lock these people up, not just rush it with a shoddy trial which these millionaires just pay for great lawyers and win so no justice.

Also fuck Zuby."
"Meanwhile she was a news story for months outside the US, but I've heard next to nothing about Joe Rogan outside of this sub. You sit in your own little bubbles making up narratives about the world like goldfish in a bowl."
Hahaha it‚Äôs so weird that you actually think this. It‚Äôs like having to listen to millions of people scream that their conservative voices are being censored.
"One count of enticement of a minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in which Ms. Maxwell is accused of coercing one girl ‚Äî identified as Minor Victim 1 in charging documents ‚Äî to travel from Florida to New York, between 1994 and 1997, to engage in sex acts with Mr. Epstein.

One count of transportation of a minor with intent to engage in illegal sex acts, which accuses Ms. Maxwell of bringing the same girl from Florida to New York on numerous occasions.

One count of sex trafficking of a minor, which charges that between 2001 and 2004, Ms. Maxwell recruited, enticed and transported another girl ‚Äî identified in the charges as Minor Victim 4 ‚Äî to engage in at least one commercial sex act with Mr. Epstein.

And three counts of conspiracy, which are related to the other counts. The conspiracy counts in the indictment are more expansive, involving all four accusers and homes in the United States and in London. These charges involve accusations that Ms. Maxwell worked with Mr. Epstein to secure underage girls for sex acts, for example, by encouraging one to give Mr. Epstein massages in London between 1994 and 1995.

"Lot's to distract from, that's for sure!   I do think Joe Rogan needs to reverse course and stop apologizing for being 'normal'  In fact, I think he should over-correct and invite the Doctors back on, but this time invite the left to discuss what 'misinformation' it was that upset them so much.  Let's invite them to an honest debate and see what happens..."
"kinda sounds like you look for a distraction to avoid the big story

unless you mean rogan, yeah thats a distraction. Russia/Ukraine? thats The story to pay attention to right now"
"True. 
FACT IS BIRDS AREN'T REAL!
They are Bird-like government drones that are watching you.
Wake up people!"
For one Rogan still has a platform to preach his bullshit. Maxwell is a totally different issue and shares nothing with Joe. There‚Äôs no reason one shouldn‚Äôt be talked more about than the other.
Ghislane Maxwell already got her sentence and is done for. Joe is still spreading misinformation.
There literally isn‚Äôt lol
Last I heard Maxwell was convicted and will spend a lot of time in prison. Why should I be outraged over that?
Whataboutism.
When's she supposed to go back to trial and we can find out who the John Does are?
Biden's crackpipe giveaway is a cover to distract from the fact any dissident who doesn't abide by the governments official taglines are now labeled terrorists - freedom of speech is suddenly gone overnight and no one is batting an eye.
Totally agree
Most people probably don't even know the name honestly.
Let‚Äôs pull our music from Spotify so people quit listening to ghislaine.
Apparently saying the forbidden word is a worse offense than child molestation and treason
"Also, it's harder to discredit those doctors Rogan talked to. That is why IMO they attacked Joe with Pfizer-linked artists marching out of Spotify, suddenly coming up with the n-word -video... A classic case of shooting the messenger and sleight of hand."
What did they use the Canadian truckers to distract us from?????üò®üò®
Did anyone in this sub really think that trial would be some sort of grand reveal? The witnesses were protected and behind closed doors. Two former presidents and a Prince aren't going to face any repercussions for their actions with Epstein. That's not how this game works!
Joe Rogan did nothing wrong.
"Lol true, she's an elite tho. Joe Rogan is just a 5ft pile of horse dewormer"
Its all about covering their own asses.
how many tweets that say exactly this are gonna get posted here like it's a new thought?
"And in an era where John‚Äôs are regularly arrested

None of the individuals involved in the sex trafficking have been named 

And somehow she has one the right to a special appeal 

Because the case is ongoing, all court records are sealed"
Ghislaine Maxwell
And by outrage we mean MSM writing stories and the Internet traffic. By outrage we mean increased brainwashing....
This might surprise you but many of us follow several things at one time lol
"And I haven't heard anything about the Mai Lai massacre lately.    

People are more concerned about Joe Rogan than the Mai Lai massacre!"
Shit crazy out here.
Don't forget about Prince Andrew...
I heard R Kelly is refusing to traffic any more underage girls until they pull down Joe Rogan's podcast. He's still on Spotify though.
"tbh thats just a sign u get ur news from shitty sources, while i know the name ive never heard any more than that about joe rogan..."
Facts
who is ghislain maxwell
"thats what they want us to believe.

in fact nobody gives a f. about Rogan in that sense.

but people do give a f. about their children being abused."
The distractions (aka BULLSHIT) will continue until late June when that see-you-next-tuesday is finally sentenced.
"The highest rated television network has around 1.6mil prime time viewers which is a sports network, while Joe Rogan hits around 11mil viewers per episode. Joe Rogan is a threat to the narrative pushed by mass media. That's why the attack on him recently. He has a larger voice and audience while pushing the opposite narrative the majority of the time. When the people who tell you what to think feel threatened they lash out."
"In other subs people responded to this ss with replies like ""Why should we be talking about Maxwell? She is in jail as she should be. What a bad take""

It's so frustrating I don't even try responding. People like that are too far gone"
"I can't believe she was murdered to hide the truth.

Oh, whats that???!?!?!?!?!?!?!?"
"Well one entity owns both democratic and republican news stations. 

And both decided not to cover Maxwell.."
But he said the N word surely that's worse than child rape. /s
Is there really tho?
Well people actually know who Joe Rogan is..  could be that's why.
I always remind people this when people are bitching on the news about Biden‚Äôs favorite ice cream flavor or some foreign president‚Äôs fashion choices. It‚Äôs always a distraction. Check out the conspiracy hub discord to be less distracted and more on point https://discord.gg/PxXtU2mTfF
"Predictably shady, sort of lends itself to the idea the maxwell's case should have been  more heavily publicised. But maxwell never took on the government. Joe rogan has a massive platform and he was like ""yeah fuck the U.S government"" on-air. Multiple times. It might have been indirectly, and I'm not saying the stuff rogan said was right or wrong. But don't fuck with the us government when you have millions of fans listening/reading. Look what happened to Julian Assange. That was/is still,(the poor bastard) an example of the worst case scenario when people of influence do that."
"Correction:

There is ""more"".  Only **the mainstream media projection and saturation** is more."
"The amount of up votes top things get in this sub is steadily increasing. I remember when very few posts got to 1k, now 1k is the reg. Tides are turning."
she's a protected mossad agent
oh yeah i forgot about her
Or EPSTEIN
"it‚Äôs insane how these people say shit like this instead of just saying something like ‚Äúyou know what, what he did was stupid‚Äù about someone who shares the same beliefs as them. and it‚Äôs just a specific group of people who are so defensive for each other in this way."
"Then make sure and post an original thought about it on Reddit so mods can lock you out, leaving you unable to defend yourself in a debate, and you end up looking sketchy and the overall interaction creates/bolsters the false narratives. Move along - nothing to see here."
More coverage*
Who?
Zuby lmao
"If Ghislaine Maxwell had a huge following in the media world, then the media would promote that story. The media is all about self-promotion for profits, and that includes Joe Rogan.

That does not mean there isn't outrage over Ghislaine Maxwell. It means there isn't ""news"" with which the media can profit regarding that story. When there is news, and let's pray there is, rest assured the media will swoop down and promote it for profit."
"To me I don't really care about the Maxwell case, it didn't directly effect me. Sure, it's awful, but I heard about it and I move on.

Joe Rogan on the other hand does have a direct impact in almost everyone's lives because chances are someone you are around or going to be around has listened to the podcast or clips of it.

That makes it a bit different in my opinion. The amount of people affected is much higher."
This sub seems to really like whataboutisms. It‚Äôs possible that two things can be bad at once. Why aren‚Äôt you outraged over what‚Äôs going on in Colombia right now? Or anything else for that matter?
DEFUND THE MSM
"Who cares about sex scandals anyways? They just wanna have some fun. Saying the N-word on the other hand....
/s"
OP is tool.
This will NEVER stop being a true statement!
