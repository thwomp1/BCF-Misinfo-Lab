Jeffrey epsteins accounts probably had more zeros. That's all it comes down to. Morals don't enter into it.
You can get away with anything if you have enough money.
Protect the (big) pedaphiles  at all cost!
"I GUARANTEE you that if the truckers had deposited billions into the bank and hooked the bank execs up with some child prostitutes, the banks would have fought a lot harder for them."
"Don't forget, banks also have an issue with a guy that makes pillows."
Those protests are controlled opposition.  Most likely they are using them to try to create food shortages.
It's where the money is
"Oh so just Making a false equivalency and acting like you actually said something of value‚Ä¶.

Got it"
It's nice to see the freedom convoy supporters comparing themselves to a fucking scum bag. They seem so close to understanding that they are part of the problem.
I hate that the conspiracy sub has become the right wing propaganda sub
"Not that this sub was ever good, I mean sure it used to be interesting and have cool posts every now and again but holy shit this sub sucks now. It‚Äôs glaringly apparent that when certain right wing subreddits were shut down that the worst came here and now all we get are shitty low effort Twitter posts from nobodies who have no ability to use critical thinking. Just stupid co-opted narratives instead of conspiracies. Sometimes I wonder if anyone here even knows what a conspiracy is anymore.."
"What do you expect? like seriously. Epstein had lots of money & didn't have a federal order against him telling them to freeze his bank accounts. Freedumb Truckers have not much money & do have a federal order freezing their bank accounts. 

&#x200B;

OK I know what y'all thinking it's about the amount of money. Well hate to break it to ya (I really hate myself here for coming out on the side of banks but strange time in which we live) it probably has more to do with the federal order."
This truck bullshit is just wasting people's time. Can't you all just grow up and act like the rest of the world?
I'd be willing to bet many of the big bank CEOs were his clients.
"Banks only care about money. They control alot because they have money, not their money, your money."
They're also fine taking cartel money to float their mortgage platform. So much for AML/KYC.
ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ I think it‚Äôs funny how you guys still don‚Äôt get how the economy we live in works.
The banks didn't know Epstein ran a pedophile ring.  They do know about the convoy occupation.  Cuz you know it's on the news and stuff.
"Their thought process is, even though he raped a bunch of kids he prob would have gotten the vax, and that is somehow better"
"Banks can have THEIR assets frozen (including the owners) if they deal with anyone performing foreign or domestic terrorism (which these freedom truckers may be labelled as in the future).

Dealing with suspected paedophiles and human traffickers does not hurt them directly.

Its pure ass covering."
Go Fund Me isn't a big bank
"SS : so the freedom loving peaceful protesters are getting their bank account frozen but they didn't have any problem for epstien being a customer. 

Shows priorities

**Edit : Got 9 Reddit Care messages.**"
What‚Äôs the conspiracy?  Jeff made them money and the truckers are losing them money.  There‚Äôs nothing not obvious here.
If we don't buy what they are selling; we are terrorist?  Nope.  WEF should know how we'd feel. You can't just steal sovereignty by force. Come one man
Epstein died while Trump was presidency‚Ä¶weird
Banks make decisions based on profit not on morality.
Epstein was one of their own.
Obviously... From a business perspective Banks need the economy to run in order to make money. Why would they care about pedophiles? Not some sort of moral stand
"Did Jeffery Epstein do a lot of banking in Canada, or am I looking at another brain dead take from this sub?"
.
'It's about our health!' üòµü•¥ü•¥ü•¥ü§¢ü§Æ
Mad comparison ‚Ä¶ What kind of twisted minds try to make connections between unconnected tipicsüòµ‚Äçüí´
So‚Ä¶ shutting down everything is appropriate?
"Using banks to damage protestors is not right. But this specific post is such ‚Äúwhataboutism‚Äù trash. 

People think they can throw a boogeyman word like Epstein and turn something into a conspiracy."
All  'bout cash
"Y'all weren't calling BLM ""freedom protesters"" when they were stupidly blocking streets for their cause. Y'all were calling to run them over. 

At least be fucking consistent. Fuck these assholes too."
It should be ‚Äúdangerous misinformation‚Äù to say he didn‚Äôt kill himself too /s
"Yes, banks are against us peasants regardless of political affiliation or color of skin. Wealth is what buys their ""loyalty""."
The amount of money Epstein was making a lot more than the truckers. You gotta keep that in mind even though there may be hundreds of truckers. The child fuckers we‚Äôre paying in the millions.
Don‚Äôt forget Bernie Madoff.
Weirdo club and i dont wanna be in it.
"Ok but its these central banks all around the globe that are the ones most heavily involved with the child sex trafficking/child sacrifice practices.  It's what the whole system is based off of. It's the Pedocracy.

Remember the video of the ex-banker who was invited to their occult rituals and child sacrifice rituals?"
"The trucking companies are losing money, therefore the protest must stop.

Plus they get a shit ton of money from American donors so fuck them."
Please keep a list of any banks that do more than the bare minimum so we can withdraw our business.
"Ford and Toyota cried to big daddy Biden, so now Justin is being pressured to do this. It‚Äôs the old follow the money, as usual."
"Saw this post with 3700 up votes, as I clicked up, I saw it go to 3699, back up to 3700 with me and immediately down one before it started going up again. They're in this group, now I know."
That is messed up.
governments and corporations in lockstep is literally fascism. We're getting called nazi white supremacists by an actual fascist. literal inverted clown world....
"Why are you shocked at this? Banks have been laundering drug money for years. You are shocked that they aren‚Äôt hosting transactions that threaten their ability to do business? Banks are not ethically responsible or required to host your transactions. If they don‚Äôt like what you are doing they can and will shut off your accounts. You don‚Äôt have a right to a bank account. Believe it or not. They go with the people that put money into their accounts, not people that use their accounts to disrupt their day to day business operations. 

How are any of you shocked?"
"I think a lot of people were just fine voting for a man for president, who was friends with Jeffrey Epstein.  (Trump)."
"Nazis bad for business, also they also didn't have the money Epstein did. That's all it came down to. They don't have the money to influence the banks the same, duh?"
Wouldn't it be more effective if they just froze all Trudeu's accounts until he ends the mandates?  Seems like a lot less work.  Not to mention they'd have logic and science on their side too.
"Its almost like money is more important...

So close, yet so far."
"So conservatives were against blocking roads for blm but when it comes to a this ""freedom"" convoy they're all about it? That's the real conspiracy.."
Do you all not know that Twitter is a CIA brainwashing program? People here use Twitter? üò±
This is either saying ‚Äúwe should let pedophiles be billionaires‚Äù or ‚Äúboth should be blocked‚Äù. Is that the point you‚Äôre trying to make???
It would be pretty hypocritical if banks took the same moral standpoint on billionaires as the rest of us
Expecting banking institutions to be morally consistent is a braindead take.
ThEY shOuLD haVE FoLLoWeD tHe lAw
It didn't hurt Jeffrey was friends with former presidents and english royalty
"So big banks were fine having Jeffrey Epstein as a customer, laundering money for terrorist organizations in the Middle East, laundering money for Mexican Cartels and also shitting on their own clients and doing anything to give Executives the biggest bonus by fucking everyone else but the line is drawn with protesting truckers? Even though I don‚Äôt agree with the protestors at all personally, I just find it mind boggling that‚Äôs the position they‚Äôre gonna take lmfao."
"*American banks is where they draw the line

FTFY"
"Well, the ‚Äúbig banks‚Äù are owned by people and families very similar to Epstein, perhaps even worse than him."
I‚Äôm embarrassed to call myself Canadian. We are becoming a communist country right before our eyes
"the first one have money, the second ones, not so much."
Epstein was American...... this is Canada
"Epstein was ""supporting"" the Establishment."
"Epstein made them exorbitant amounts of money. The convoy wanted to shut down whatever it was (local economy on by blocking the bridge in Canada or just increasing traffic in DC) which would cost them money. Follow the money, and you will find the supporters."
"He had multiple different bank accounts. Celebrities / clients would have access to wire money and when it came in, it looked a publicity deal or some shit. They could‚Äôve even payed cash, had some type of trade deal, frequent buyer deals,"
"Yes, antivax dickheads is the line"
This will just strenghten bitcoin. How many of those that are affected by this will convert some fiat to BTC? I'd imagine quite a lot.
"""You helped Epstein, you should help me!""
Is not a good argument"
"Wow, you guys managed to crack the conspiracy that banks don't like people who cost their biggest clients money! Congratulations on your stellar detective work!"
Isn't it funny that far right people had to go to a sub meant for conspiracies to share ideas lol
I remember when this sub was kinda more fun. Now it is only anti vac trumper asshole rejects. Fuck you all. I hate your fucking guts.
Eat the bankers lol
"They would be fine if truckers smuggle some kids for politicians to ""play with"" I'd assume."
"Don‚Äôt ever assume a bank will have the same narrative you have. They are about $$$. They don‚Äôt care about Epstein or a convoy unless it benefits them.

Btw, that applies to politicians (left and right), media (including Rogan), etc."
"Ah yes, the multinational corporation ""Big Bank"" which controls the actions and decisions at every bank in the world"
That‚Äôs the world we live in now
"More antivax bullshit disguised as a conspiracy. 

What I want to know is to what end is this bullshit being pushed so hard for? Is it Russia? Someone has a great interest in seeing the West become sick and destabilized. They pay these shills and troll farms to spread this bullshit here. Some of these folks are working together to pretend like they are agreeing and convincing folks. Really, it's ivan and vlad next to each other in a room convincing you they're frank and joe from two different states."
