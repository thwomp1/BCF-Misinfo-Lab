"Akin to the way corn has been modified to produce greater levels of carbohydrates and starch we need to invest heavily in seaweed and Kelp. Both are vitamin rich and contain good amounts fiber. In powder form they could be used to replace other fillers like: soy, wheat, pea, corn, nuts, etc. 

Reduce demand for those other products will help (not solve) the water situation since seaweed and Kelp are ground in the ocean. No Forrests need to be burned down or arid lands watered."
Insect borne diseases will also be a major concern. Both for people and animals.
"Improving water supply is trivially easy from an engineering perspective.

"I remember in 2016 when Bernie Sanders stood on the stage and said the greatest national security threat is climate change and people scoffed and continued to ignore the threat as they always have. 

Lake Mead is drying up, Texas can’t handle the heat, thousands of cows died from flash heat in Midwest, Europe heat wave, Australia fires; this is just what I rattle off the top of my head... I’m afraid of the future for my child."
"Increased demand for water will be the No. 1 threat to food security in the next 20 years, followed closely by heat waves, droughts, income inequality and political instability, according to a new CU Boulder-led study which calls for increased collaboration to build a more resilient global food supply.

The report, published today in One Earth, comes as global hunger levels in 2021 surpassed the previous record set in 2020, and acute food insecurity in many countries could continue to worsen this year, according to the United Nations and The World Bank.

These pressing threats are not new: The impacts of political conflict and compounding environmental effects of climate change are already measured and studied around the world. The new study, however, finds that increased collaboration between these areas of research could not only fortify global food security in the face of any one of these threats, but also strengthen it against all of them. 

“We provide strong support for the idea of building more resilient food systems in general, rather than trying to deal with individual problems here and there,” said Zia Mehrabi, lead author on the study, and assistant professor of environmental studies and in the Mortenson Center in Global Engineering. “It doesn't matter whether it’s a climate, environmental or political shock to the system—if you have resilient systems in place, they'll be able to deal with all the different kinds of shocks.”

"It’s crazy how much we waste fresh water on things these days that won’t matter in 20-50 years when water will be a scarce resource. 

We’re already seeing the start of the water crisis in some parts of the world where they don’t have as much direct access to fresh and drinkable water forcing them to impose restrictions on citizens during droughts."
Is it not cost effective to have solar desalination plants in the dessert on a massive scale?  They can run miles of oil why not do ocean water. We have a large amount of land in the Sonoran desert that we don't touch and haven't been to in years that was inherited. I would be willing to let the government use it for this purpose as would others. I mean how hard would it be to run it in the median of a road through the country?

"I took hydrogeology.

The rate at which we utilize our groundwater in the US far surpasses the recharge rate of the aquifers.

Some rural areas in the US are already having issues accessing it. A big drain in water actually comes from growing nuts.

But there are already places such as India where access to clean drinking water is a major problem.

This was all without reference to global warming, which will indeed make the food supply worse, as it already has been putting farmers out of business.

Edit: As many have helpfully added, livestock, particularly cattle, consume notably more water than nuts. I'm starting to recall my professor pointed out alf-alfa (grown to feed livestock) particularly as taking a lot of water.)

From business insider, ""A whopping 106 gallons of water goes into making just one ounce of beef. By comparison, just about 23 gallons are needed for an ounce of almonds (about 23 nuts), the Los Angeles Times reported recently"""

"Same message, every time, nothings changed, in decades, and hundreds of people in various developed countries are holding up everything the population of those countries wants and needs. 

The world is fucked until we get rid of the trash."
"Yes its too late to reverse climate change, but its not too late to build resilient food systems— that’s the point. Building resilient food systems is like putting on our armor to prepare for war— its what will protect humanity as we encounter the global calamities of climate change. Resilient food systems means alot of things— it means strengthening local food systems, transition to regenerative agriculture, increasing biodiversity in farms, reducing monoculture, more urban farms, more urban green spaces (also good for stormwater management), reducing barriers to farmer distribution, decreased subsidies for meat and animal feed, more plant based diets and less meat based diets, efficient municipal composting systems (imagine that!), vertical farming, reducing/eliminating CAFOs, aquaponics (especially in drought zones)… what am I missing?"

"We haven't cared about countries with famines, droughts, weather-related destruction before, do the experts think this time rich countries are going to collaborate to help Africa, India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka etc now?

There may be wars amongst those countries, but keeping them poor and/or destitute has been the status quo. The only thing that is going to happen is a collaboration to keep poor people from migrating. Which is already happening with northern African countries. Look for rich countries to fund countries that wish to prevent mass migration, on the guise of ""security"", like Libya."
In places such as singapore they already are using recycled water.
"Extreme political corruption undercuts resilience and the ability of any people to deal with a huge range of threats and challenges.  

One level of humanity's collective intelligence is being able to diagnose problems.  The next level is identifying actual, achievable solutions.  And the next level is actually implementing those solutions.

Without dealing with systemic corruption, every other problem becomes much harder to solve, because one person's problem is often another person's profit, so there are too many vested interests in keeping things the same or making them worse for ""other"" people.

"time for companies to stop gate keeping water.
water is a human right. PERIOD."
"""Increased collaboration."" If that's where our hope lies we're doomed.  I am convinced that there is a class of people, let's call them ""Republicans,"" (every region has something approximating them) who will do everything in their power to make certain that THEY possess the last jug of water, the last quart of milk and the last gallon of gas simply so that they can have some when others do not.  They will do this in spite of any and all evidence that sharing sparse supplies is the means by which the greatest number can survive and eventually prosper."

I'll bet that the income inequality and political instability play the biggest part in this i.e. the things that we humans can actually control.
Switching to a plant based diet would reduce water usage so effing much but some people would rather make everyone die or suffer than doing that.
How can I buy stock in water?
"I hope somebody reads this.

I live in Southern Alberta Canada. A relatively short drive away from the Montana border. This area is blue collar, right-wing Canada redneck. We love them for it honestly but in even doses. Many of them are rig workers. They love their jobs and refuse to do anything else.

What if...

We re-purposed some oil pipelines for water? Drillers could go for underground water reserves and pump it to treatment plants, reservoirs, irrigation canals, indigenous communities that do not have strong infrastructure or are remote... anywhere that needs water. The pipelines are already in place and adding to them couldn't be that difficult. Drilling crews would be doing literally the same thing that they do now but for water instead of oil and they would be supplying something that is in high demand.

I don't see any negatives to this...

Penny for your thoughts?"
"globalization is the very reason we are seeing countries unable to source food and water, the last thing we need is a more ""global food supply""."
More food = more people = more problems. Solutions need to be broader and population needs to be on the table.
"History shows that  Robert Malthus has not been correct for 100+ years.   Everyone else that predicted food production shortfalls has been equally as wrong, just as they will be the next 20 years.     

History has shown in the last 100 years that income inequality and political instability were the primary causes of famine each time and will prove to be so again for the next 20 years.

Still it begs the question, ""Where will the food come from for the 8 billion people we now have and the extra animal product demands from people whose income rises from a few hundred dollars a year to several thousand?      Lettuce start with the enormous food waste in the USA and if needed stop the conversion of millions of tons of corn into transportation fuel."
there is a book out there called the price of thirst on this subject.
The income inequality causes many of the other issues as a side effects. Only so many resources and when .01 percent control 50+ percent with a level of callous disregard that would have impressed the Nazis....lots of starvation etc.

"I had professors saying that many years ago, nobody listens or does anything to change anything, I think Humanity will be hit hard because people are selfish."
Places like Mexico and California need to invest heavily in alternative crops. The governments need to force it to happen because those rich farmers are never going to give up their almonds and avocados otherwise. Then need to provide subsidies and deadlines allowing the farmers to convert x% of land to alternative less water intensive crops over x amount of years.
*laughs in Scotland* we don't even have water metres yet!(I believe we do have it put into our council tax but I digress!)
No wonder China is building damns and not giving account for the water collected to India in northeast. They are gonna use this as a weapon.

"Real question:

Would a resurgence of ""victory gardens"", as seen during WWII, help mitigate this problem?

The article talks about diversifying crops on an international scale but what if it's done on a much smaller scale too?"
Income inequality is the root of all the other issues. Water rights are controlled by corporations. We make plenty of food we just throw most away. People can't afford access to the food they produce in developing areas when it's worth more boxed up and shipped to other countries. Untethered greed has led us to all of these consequences.
Good thing we have all those lush green golf courses across the good old USA! Biggest waste of water ever!
