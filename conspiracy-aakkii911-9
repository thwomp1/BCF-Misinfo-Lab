"Thank God that comment was highlighted with a giant red circle, I would have missed it otherwise."
I'd fully expect people to have different reactions to Shanghai being locked down for a virus vs the potential start of WWIII. Don't think there's much 'conspiracy' here other than the media prioritizing news that *isn't* COVID.
"Please ban stupid Twitter screenshots of literal nobodies and utterly useless red circles.

This is nothing!
Wow someone tweeted a thing I agree with... THEN GO AHEAD AND LIKE IT OR WHATEVER, BUT THIS IS NOT CONSPIRACY WORTHY.

Want to talk about Shangai and how disappointed you are in mainstream media, make a post open for discussion about it and MAYBE, MAYYYYYYBE, add the link for reference, as if you couldn't articulate the idea yourself.


""This is so accurate"" really? Is that your input? Sounds like a bot to me"
"I don't think a country invading another country is comparable to a government controlling its people. There is a reason few don't care about four or five ongoing civil wars.

Either way, I wouldn't doubt people like her were quick to criticize anyone breaking curfews and lockdowns in the US over the past two years. Certain protests were allowed, of course."
Isn't the big international consensus is that what happens within sovereign borders stays within sovereign borders. When you impede on anothers sovereignty is when shit gets amuck.
Totally comparable situations.
"Shanghai wasn't invaded. It's fascists doing fascist stuff. 
They don't want to starve, there's lots of meat telling them to stay indoors. 

Best of luck."
"The media covered Shanghai, Even Dickhead Ted Cruz tried to cash in and try to seem human for a moment! It wasn't as big a deal for us because it didn't hold the implications it did for that region. This isnt necessary as much politics or media but a matter of geography and intelligent analysis!"
Or for Palestine
Because Shanghai isn't in a fucking war
Why is no one in this sub standing against Russia?
"Damn sheeple! I just do what my phone tells me instead.
Also, this isn't a conspiracy. ⬇️"
Can we stand against satanic rituals and it’s relation to child sex abuse? No. Because it’s never mentioned and nobody cares or believes.
"Telling that a vocal minority in the west actually wanted China-like zero covid policy to be implemented, while a silent majority acquiesced. 

Also, helps that China does what China does, and no one can bitch about it because it’s fucking **in** China and most Chinese support it (back to the above mentioned vocal minority and their silent enablers here too)"
"This makes people here look really dumb, congratulations.  But maybe that was your intent..."
"Russia has had thousands of ICBMs pointed at the United States for 60 years. They constantly talk about nuclear war with the US on state media. We have been adversaries for 80 years. The softness towards Russia is hard to understand. 

What happens in Ukraine matters a lot to the words safety and stability.  It’s absolutely something we should follow closely. So yes it’s in the news a lot."
No its not. A bunch of programs highlighted the injustices in Shanghai and people were and are still upset about that.  People can be upset about more than one thing.
Eye roll
Or Palestine.
Because Shanghai is a disaster created by the CCP Xi Jinping!  Not a foreign invasion!
Who the fuck are these tweeters?
This is a fucking dumb post and op is dumb
"Ah yes I’m so enlightened, I don’t get my political information from the TV, I get all my information from more reliable sources such as skimming long Reddit comments full of links which look legit😎"
What is the conspiracy here? Bigfoot orchestrated the blanket ban on Shanghai news to stop UFO evidence from being leaked?
Does this sub not understand Russia invaded sovereign Ukraine? I thought all the Russian bot farms got banned.
Governments are waging war on their own citizens using any “emergency” as an excuse
"Damn. Elon Musk is really making his Shanghai workers sleep in his gigafactory. 😂

https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/20/23033394/tesla-shanghai-factory-sleep-eat-factory-closed-loop-covid

So, thinking about it: Elon Musk became a right wing super star following his tweets about the lockdowns in California that prevented him from building in his Tesla factory. Strangely, he has made zero comments on China's lockdowns where they're literally having his employees live during the lockdown. Weird. Was it ever about the lockdowns? Is Elon afraid to tweet anything negative about China? How is his China relations going to impact a ""free speech"" Twitter?"
"Very true, but to be fair Ukraine people suffer hunger AND are under constant artillery attacks…"
You suddenly give a fuck about what china does inside its own borders. Go sleep on a landmine left from putins retreat of a failed military exercise.
"All this time they said ""the TV is only showing corona related stuff!""
But now where there is war in Europe and maybe the beginning of world war 3 it's ""omg why isnt the tv showing corona news from china!!!!"""
Imagine comparing a lockdown to an invasion
"Its propaganda, pandemic measures, to smoke screen the reality of them shutting down 2 of them worlds largest porta.  World supply will collapse"
Can you imagine being a person who only cares about what the TV tells you to?
"Shanghai has a complete media lockdown, they dont want attention. Ukraine is calling for as much attention as possible to get assistance."
The TV wants business in China
That's not even the third worst thing going on in China right now.
Palistine is also a thing
Same with palestine
Insanely accurate.
"Ah, yes, people protesting a lockdown is equivalent to entire cities being leveled for the sake of conquest.  ...."
This post and op are fucking stupid. Two completely different issues happening.
Seeing how the elite's are in favor for the neo nazi's and terriost organizations i would say that's why 100%.
So why are all the replies saying that the post is bullshit but there are like 4.3 likes?
Television rules the nation
Did Russia invade Shanghai?
"I’m getting so fucking sick of Zelensky demanding more Western guns and money and shaming us into more sanctions.   

I’m really tired of it.  Yes Russia is a fucking bully.  Putin sucks and they are invading murderers.  We all know this.  However the way the west has been handling this war from the sidelines is fucked up too.   

Russia said the war will end tomorrow if the west can put its pride away for a god damn second,  and simply say “we will not expand NATO into the Ukraine”.   The war would immediately end: 

“A top Russian foreign ministry official told Russian media that Moscow will end its military operation when Nato stops using Ukraine to threaten it”
BBC News online 4/21 

But western military will never swallow their pride not even to save lives.   We are power hungry and manipulative and we lie to our people just as bad as any other major power.   We just dress it up and make it look nice so everyone falls for the bullshit Hollywood charm.   

Fuck both Russia and NATO.   No troll or bot will convince me otherwise"
Isn't there a **huge** difference between one country enforcing a lock down due to a virus and one country military invading another?
"Shitty pandemic response = full scale invasion.  


tHiS iS sO aCcUrAtE"
What’s going on in Shanghai
Same as Yemen. The tv tells people what to be sad and mad about
Wow! So fucking true! Liberals owned! Epic! LOL!!
do people still watch tv
"The real reason no one is talking about Shanghai.

https://youtu.be/JqMQk337p5s"
What about China attacking India back in 2020? Or the Muslim death camps in China? Or China saying they are force sterilizing Muslim for “women’s rights”?
The only similarity is both problems were caused by fascist dictators. The kind of authoritarian government this sub is so keen on supporting.
If anyone in the world would like some weapons.  America would love to give them.
Anyone remember when this subreddit was actually conspiracy based. and not alt right talking points?
You think Shanghai is a country?
MSM says Russia Bad...China Good
Nailed it
Truer words have never been spoken
"Ugh, because it’s a country doing stupid shit to itself?"
Boost it if you actuatll give a fuck. Seems like you probably just dislike ukraine
"Pretty funny since you haven't said anything about them either.

🤔🤔"

"Because it's a lock down,  not a full scale invasion. Lot easier for China to push rhetoric around the internet that can down play the severity of the lock down. You can't down play a full scale invasion when no other world powers support you."
🙄
"Actually jokes on you it wasn’t my tv, it was my computer"
Tell-a-vision
Because the CCP owns Biden
"Not people comparing tyrannical government regimes that murder their own citizens to a small war between 2 nations.  Honestly tho the ukrain war can fuck off, what happens in China is far more important"
I don't stand with anyone but my fellow Americans. Not going to fight for your country.
"Oh c'mon!! You really don't see a difference? A whole nation is facing orks invasion and frankly speaking being, being eradicated... ruskis are bringing back ussr symbols ( no joke..they want to bring it all back to schools too) and are pushing back for the times where they practically enslaved all of Eastern Europe... cities are being grinded to the the ground... and you comparing it to lockdown. Yes, situation in shanghai it's not good, but Jesus... scale is massively different here."
It's not just TV'S it's their phones. Constant feed every second of the day.
"Holy strawman batman

Invasion is not comparable to lockdowns because of a pandemic, even if they botched getting supplies to people

Shouldn't we be worried about that? They wouldn't lock down and pretty much halt production for shits and giggles. 

Its hurting their baseline, and people really like money"
is there a foreign country invading shanghai killing thousands in the process?
The lefties are in the comments making excuses as to why Shanghai’s people don’t matter. The concerns aren’t valid because it’s not a war apparently 🙄
"Shanghai being compared to Ukraine is a strange thing to do. One is already part of the authoritarian country, while the other is a seperate country the authoritarian is invading.

There are other comparisons that work a lot better. Israel VS Palestine, Hong Kong VS China, America VS your chosen country in the middle East, and the list goes on. Hong Kong for example shows that the people are willing to show support for other countries, but companies and countries are too dependant on China to be willing to put any sanctions or support another side in a conflict. The rest is just politics, people don't care about other people they have little in common with across the world."
Is Shanghai fucking up Russia? I hadn't heard that.
"Ss: we have seen lot of standing and support for Ukraine but not for people on Shanghai or Yemen north Korea or Palestinians which are going through one of the most horrific time of their life. Because their 📺 dint told them.

Edit : 23 reddit care messages. Thanks for caring."
Ever just want to frame someone's reply because it's so classic. That was so butta
Asinine take. Completely different situations
Who illegally invaded Shanghai?   I missed that part.
"My theory on this thing.
Biden already cut a deal with China to take it over.
China is waiting for us to get our new fabs up and running before they move in.
Could be wrong but, could be right too."
"Watch only OAN and Newsmax.
Read, Beforeitsnews on the web.
The truth is there."
Who the fuck still watches TV?
How many more examples like this do people need?
Yep
They deserve it
First we need to gather the names of all the other places committing genocide before he has that question.
I fee like ppl don’t care cause it’s expected
Please most people on here hate China
our politicians don't launder their stolen American taxpayer money through Shanghai
What is Shanghai? Is that like a place or a person or something? I'm American so I don't need to know these things.
Because the TV knows it could happen here next.
Very well stated!!! All these duck loving cowards
"Putin has very clearly stated that when he's done with Ukraine he's coming for the Baltics next and us supporting Ukraine right now is ensuring security for us, Baltics. Also despicable events happening in Shanghai isn't one country invading another. It's still considered a Chinese city who is just trying to break loose from it. Ukraine is a separate country from Russia and it's not just dictator power killing it's own citizens, it is a full scale invasion from another country that hasn't been seen on European continent for almost a century.

&#x200B;

Still, I agree with that question on that screenshot but there's a big geopolitical difference between the two. Why is nobody standing for Palestine?"
"I guess I’m just happy to have the brain function I have when I see posts/tweets like this. 

Some people are so dumb that their social media is just a public embarrassment of themselves. This is one of those times."
"Well, the people of shanghai are being oppressed by the government of shanghai; the people of ukraine are being invaded by a foreign country, so it is apples to oranges.

But I do believe people should be outraged by the way china treats its citizens."
TV told me to eat Snickers today so I do it. Duh.
Whenever I attempt to talk about other ongoing wars or instances of oppression….and there are many…I am almost always shouted down by people parroting what CNN et al have force-fed them about Ukraine.
when you put it that way I mean.
Last I saw there were people complaining in this sub that posting about Shanghai was just a distraction. Sooooo...are we now allowed to ask what the hell is going on in Shanghai? I thought this would be top priority here seeing that it's clearly an Orwellian nightmare. But then again a lot of people here praise an authoritarian dictator who murders his opponents and will throw you in jail for protesting or saying their country is in a war. Doublethink is rife here.
Ukraine isn't Russian while Shanghai is Chinese?  Countries don't get too involved in internal affairs of other countries.   These two things are not the same
aMeRica Is a GOOd Kountri they help other countries so much (by bombimg other countries and then claiming to protect the world)
"Shanghai not currently at war, Ukraine is, this is the difference, enjoy your hateful hearts though"
"Yup,  that sums up America. Unless the media tells America to do something then America doesn't do it."
People care more about things which have a higher liklyhood to effect them...
Are you? Are any of you? Then who really gives a shit? Sitting around pointing out hypocrisy is useless.
Because the US economy is tied to China and Hunter Biden is within the pockets of CCP.
Because the US economy is tied to China and Hunter Biden is within the pockets of CCP.
Who is out there not caring about what's going on in Shanghai? As far as I've seen everyone is paying very close attention to what is going on there and disagrees with China's methods
More like because China is garbage and I hope they’re nation kills off most of them and their stupid overly populated nation. Why can’t India and China war for the greater good of all humanity?
"Why should we stand up for china? If anything, we should stand up against china"
Idk. but maybe its because those are completly different things?
Did Shanghai get invaded?
Politicians  aren't  using it to launder money  for thier cokehead children...and no oil of course
Ever notice that Elon won't say a peep about Shanghai or China in general?  Wonder why that is?
If they want people to stand with Shanghai they should do something about the 50 cent shill army who keep telling the world how great China is and that nothing we suspect is happening is actually happening.
"Another RFA/CIA post setting up the 'Both sides' fallacy in regards to US imperium v. China taking action inside its own sovereign borders.

Why exactly 'Must' China scrap its national restrictions and let a virus spread in a country of 1.4Bn people, Just for the ease of operating of large companies? \[Which is often the hidden sub-text of these various articles about chinese lockdowns\]"

shanghainese are not fighting a war. they're just locked down and killing themselves by jumping off a building. once the cpp start shooting shanghainese i'm sure these people will come around and start standing with the shanghainese.
