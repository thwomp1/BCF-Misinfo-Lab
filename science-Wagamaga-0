"This is classically known as the “Matthew Effect,” Google it.  

The opposite can be seen when “rich kids” cannot seem to fail hard enough and more resources just keep showing up.  Then they’re “successful” despite themselves."
This is why social safety nets and welfare are so important; they prevent people from becoming mired in poverty (when they’re effectively set up).

"Chronic poverty in the developing world can seem like an insoluble problem. But a long-term study from Bangladesh co-authored by an MIT economist presents a very different picture: When rural poor people get a one-time capital boost, it helps them accumulate assets, find better occupations, and climb out of poverty.

In particular, the study strongly suggests that poverty is not principally the product of people’s capabilities or attitudes. Rather, the very poor are usually mired in a poverty trap, in which an initial lack of resources prevents them from improving their circumstances. But the sudden acquisition of a productive asset — even, say, one cow — via a randomized asset transfer program can help spring the poor from that trap if it brings them above a basic wealth threshold. Instead of being farm laborers or domestic servants, rural people take up livestock rearing and more land cultivation, and sustain better incomes.

“The poor in these contexts are not unable to take on more productive employment, they simply lack the productive assets to do so,” says Clare Balboni, an assistant professor of economics at MIT and co-author of a published paper detailing the study’s findings.

The study adds evidence explaining what lies behind the success of “big push” antipoverty programs, which often center on significant one-time interventions. As the paper states, “big push policies which transform job opportunities represent a powerful means of addressing the global mass poverty problem.” Such programs have gained traction over the last 15 years or so.

"The rich get richer isn't a saying, it's fact. 

 * A rich person can buy a new car, no problems, no issues. 

* A rich person can buy a EV, running costs are now 10x less than a generic car. 

* Many nice cars actually go up in value, i knew someone that bought Porsches, kept them for a few years and sold them for profit. 

* You can buy multiple homes, they go up in value = now you're even richer

* You can invest your extra cash, now your money is making you money. 
* you can afford various operations to make you look better/ proven to be an advantage in life and in a professional environment. 
* you can afford to go to better schools= more likely to get better jobs
* you have rich friends surrounding you, you'll get some of their business even if you don't try. 
* Every step you take in life as a rich person only helps you advance further and further."
"poverty is expensive. zero headroom for quality and everyone wants from you, not giving credit without outragous interest that makes you even poorer.

terry pratchet called it the boot problem.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boots_theory

quote
---

The reason that the rich were so rich, Vimes reasoned, was because they managed to spend less money. Take boots, for example. He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles. But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that'd still be keeping his feet dry in ten years' time, while a poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet."

"I would hazard to guess it's by design. Any measures to help such people go far enough to be just short of them having the resources they need to actually get out of poverty, because powerful people want them to be in poverty and continually work hard for the dream to get out of poverty, and also want as much of the middle class to slide into that poverty hole as possible."
We have enough food and houses for everyone and yet people starve and go homeless. This is a decision we make as a society.

"I'll give you an example of me growing up poor compared to a friend I met in college.

We never took vacations. No fancy restaurants. At times parents didn't eat so the children(2 total) could. Toys only came on birthdays or Christmas. Family car barely functioned. No ac in house. Winter months were extra blankets. No nice name brand clothes. At 14 I got a job and went to school to take the burden off my family, multiple buses and long walks in between school work and home. I realized how much money controls ones life, happiness and health.

My buddy, private schools. Tutors when he didn't understand anything. Fancy restaurants, brand new car at 16, all bills paid for, school tuition paid for, he had time to actually study while I was working. Expensive vacations, new clothes so often he didn't even wear all of them. Money put away for a house.

We ended up just talking how if ppl are born poor how hard it is for them to come up in life. That the opportunities and environment keep them from succeeding. I think the stress free environment also contributes to mental health. Yes theyr are some who will overcome their fate, but not many. Outside of good looks or naturally taleneted."
Man I can't wait for next week when these scientists prove that dogs have tails and air is good for you
"I've been able to intuit this for some time, just by having been exposed to a few truly wealthy people. They're the same dumbasses as the rest of us. It's just they have different circumstances. It seems true that this would hold for the other end of the spectrum."

"As a single homeless man I feel like once I was sleeping on the street it's been a full circle whirlpool that just keeps going around and around. It's hard to think about the future when your primarily worried about getting through the day, never mind the mental toll it takes. Which can make even the most average Joe turn to drugs, just to ease the pressure for a little while. And while I don't make excuses for my faults, I definitely would have been back in my feet had the right help been available."
"Is nobody here going to mention the obvious fact that this poverty is largely intentional and a necessary feature of capitalism? If workers are compensated equivalent to the value they produce, then there's no surplus value for the accumulation of capital, and thus no wealth disparity will develop. The actual trap is capitalism itself, and no amount of welfare is going to fix this unless it's paired with the nationalization of industry."

"If you look at the category split between how people proportionally spend their money (housing, food, bills etc), there's barely a difference between richest and poorest. Poor people just don't have enough money."

"Anyone who has been poor knows this. 

It's not mindset or effort or skill or the grind. Bootstraps won't do it either. 

Class mobility is a real issue and it's expensive to be poor."
"There is  a component of attitude  involved.  Places like eastern Kentucky people take pride in their ability to live with almost nothing, and resist improvements because it would mean radical change in their lifestyle.   There is also a certain fatalism, people think they aren’t going to succeed so they don’t make any attempt."
Exactly. We need unions back.
The poverty trap has gotten a lot bigger with rents doubling recently in many parts of the country.

"Economic flight.

People congregate with people of similar financial status.

"Like many things, poverty probably involves self-reinforcing mechanisms. As OP mentioned, bad initial conditions results in fewer resources to improve, leading to worse conditions. 

On the bright side, this also potentially means it takes very little resources to make a difference. A little help could also be self-reinforcing."
"This makes sense.

70k (arbitrary number but to make a point) starting from nothing is so hard to work towards, and can yield so much in return.

70k starting from 7+ figures is nothing, and would barely register on the radar if it went missing. 

Getting to that initial 70k is the poverty trap that can take a lifetime of work."
"Alright, so I have lived in public housing and received SNAP benefits. As far as these are concerned I fell there is no incentive to get off of these programs. If you try to do better your benefits immediately start reducing. To the point where you can't afford to work compared to paying obscene amounts in rent. I think there should be a gradual and tiered approach to weaning people off government subsidies. And also unless you are mentally and physically unable to work there should be time limits if you are unwilling to work. Or have to work around the town doing something even something as simple as picking up trash"

"It feels short-sighted to say people’s attitudes and mentality aren’t a factor in poverty. It’s something that’s difficult to quantify in a study, but having grown up surrounded by it and been in it myself, state of mind is absolutely a big component.

Having said that, I do believe the study here ultimately carries water. That’s because while state of mind is a big component, so is frame of reference. Extreme, generational poverty completely alters the way you mind views the world. It makes it harder to recognize your chances to “get out”, because getting out is fiction. How do you “get out” of the “real world”? This isn’t the Matrix, you don’t just get to jack-in to an alternate reality where you have a chance. 

The resources and opportunities that people in poverty do not get prevent them from seeing the world as it could be, instead of how it is. It’s difficult to delude yourself into flights of fantasy and imagination when you’re struggling to survive.

We need to improve our social safety nets, and our mechanisms that protect the least fortunate among us. Give them a chance to dream, a chance to see a new reality. Show them just how deep the rabbit hole goes."
"It was done in Bangladesh.  I would like to see how this changes in different countries, as I am sure different cultures of poverty also exist.  In countries with generational poverty that is supported by social safety nets, is this still true?  Or have all the people with the ability to be mobile already climbed their way to the middle class?"
"It's always surprising to hear a study that seems so common sense. If you've spent any time completely broke you know that the less money you have the more stuck you are. Many times it's a catch 22. I remember a time not eating for days each week because I didn't have enough for food because any money I made went to bank fees or was automatically garnished.

Now that I'm in a better position the banks are throwing me money and waiving fees just because I hold a specified amount in there. Its frustrating because I WANT to pay fees now if it means that homeless and poor people could have a free safe place to store money without the chance of it getting robbed or garnished."
I'm glad a study was done but this should be plainly obvious. Why would huge portions of the population choose to be poor? Why would the kids of poor parents just happen to freely choose poverty more than others?
Takes money to make money. So if you got no money…
I understand that we have to constantly review are standards but god damn does this seem so stupid. Some people succeed by failing while others can be screwed even after doing everything right
"All the morons who grew up poor “I CaN dO iT, whY nOt TheM?”

"My social worker gf refers to it as the “Benefits Cliff”

Where your so poor you get tons of benefits and resources, but once you make a dollar more than the maximum amount, all those resources are gone, and the maximum amount is abysmally low, so you end up worse off. 

So tons of Americans voluntarily chose to remain ass poor if they cannot get a job that propels them to success immediately."
"When I was in high school I once had to choose between rent, college, food, and car insurance. One of them had to go.

I chose rent, college, and food but I still had to drive.

After I received my tickets for no insurance no registration I thought I was financially ruined.

Fortunately, the judge took pity on me and gave me 100 hours of community service. I know not everyone gets the same breaks.

If you are at the bottom and you play by the rules you will never break out."
"This is 100 percent true.

Took me 10 years to escape poverty and it was definitely a trap. The whole system is designed to keep you in it."

"Poverty exists today because of the wide-spread belief it’s still necessary.

Endemic poverty is a specious feature of modern economic monocultures. The provision of subsistence is still gated behind employment because of a manufactured belief perpetuation, and has been progressively less so because of the efficiencies realised by societies since at least the industrial revolution."

"I see people on Reddit dismiss UBI studies because ""of course people's lives improve when they get free money."" But the fact is, it's expensive and cognitively-taxing to be poor, and the average person would not be able to lift themselves out of poverty without some money and resources to better their situation."
