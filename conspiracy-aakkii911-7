Who in the Senate block it? The Who is important.
"Only 5 Republican senators voted in favor of the restaurants and small businesses bill, if we're pointing fingers."
Let's be clear about who in the senate blocked this.
The last 2 years has been about the controlled demolition of the world economy
"Ah, and who voted against the aid for restaurants and small businesses? 

&#x200B;

Cool."
What's in the aid package that was blocked? I always assume the name given to anything in govt is fraudulent. Remember the Patriot Act anyone?
"While I agree that these actions display a massive disconnect between US politicians and the actual needs/desires of common Americans - calling it ""Treason"" is absolutely wrong. Treason has a very specific definition & shouldn't be dilluted by bullshit like this. 

Call it unhelpful. Call it arrogant. Call it disappointing. Call it grounds for being replaced next election. But it's just not treason. It just isn't."

"And guess which party voted against that aid package.  

https://www.thehill.com/news/senate/3494868-senate-blocks-48-billion-aid-package-for-restaurants-other-small-businesses/amp/ 

Only 5 GOP senators voted in favor, along with every Democrat.  All the other Republicans voted against it.

It helps to pay attention to the details that matter."
can't we not send twitter screen shot posts for 5 MINUTES!
"Y‚Äôall know what it means, vote breakdown wise, when the senate blocks something in 2022, right?

It means every Republican plus Joe Manchin voted no."
Nice try ignoring who voted against the domestic bill
Now do Israel.
"I love that posts like this get popular and say ‚Äúthe senate‚Äù when it‚Äôs the gop and republicans that are responsible for this, but we‚Äôll get the same tired both sides arguments"
"Did they send physical cash, gold or what?"
That‚Äôs not treason.
">‚ÄúDemocrats need to wake up and realize that dumping more money in the economy is simply pouring $5-a-gallon gas on an already out-of-control fire,‚Äù Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) said in a speech leading up to the vote.

Lol, what a joke."
Time to start pointing at the elephants in the room

Small businesses are a threat to the donors of the politicians - big businesses. So it‚Äôs win-win for them.
Why is everyone acting like this is a zero-sum game? We can fund both Ukraine and small businesses. Have you tried looking at subsidies or TAXING THE FUCKING RICH?
"That headline should say ""Republicans block"". Because it was Republicans who blocked it"
what do you expect? hell will freeze over and the devil will be give free sleigh rides before the republicans support any bill the democrats want. their entire reason for existing at this point is literally to fuck the libs and make biden look bad.
"Right, because this is the cost of fighting Russia WITHOUT having to fight Russia. Welcome to how the world works in the 21st century.

Now talk about the pieces of shit who voted against fixing the baby formula shortage. If you aren't sure who they are, they are the same ones who voted against the bill that would make it illegal to sell gas at an excessive price during an energy emergency."
"52 voted for the bill and 43 voted against, with 5 not voting.  It seems like this really could have helped  small businesses bounce back after covid.  Why would 43 senators not want to support small businesses in their own states?"
Or money laundering whatever definition you‚Äôd like to use
Almost as if they WANT our country to fail
I will never understand why we waste so much money on helping other countries when we are still fucked at home.
Ukraine aide comes at a price.. To Ukraine
How about we give money to neither. Isn't this what the UN is for? Why is the US always getting involved directly.
Lol is everything treason now?
Republicans tanked the bill. All democrats voted for it except 3 didn‚Äôt vote. The total was 52-43. It need 60 to pass.
"It's covid money....they don't want to justify any more money going somewhere because of COVID because then COVID is then still a thing. If money is allocated elsewhere, then that is the new issue. WASH....RINSE....REPEAT."
Time to start shooting at the US government.
"I'm gonna guess it failed with a 51-49 vote, with Manchin being the lone democrat who voted no."
"Finally, a good post here."
hahahahaha they hate you
Keep in mind republicans blocked all of that AND the baby formula bill. Time to vote for the progressive left. Enough is enough.
There is no political solution... everything is under jewish control.
How much are they sending to Israel?
"Remember, when the Senate blocks it that's Republicans blocking it."
Laughable that anyone but the uber rich vote for Republicans.
Proxy wars are a tax money-laundering system. Simple as that
"Does anyone read before they comment?  The vote was on ending debate, not the bill itself"
"Government of the racketeers, by the racketeers, and for the racketeers. But, at least we aren't ruled by kings anymore."
"There's always money for war.

People are actions, not their words."
"Fuck giving aid to businesses, a lot of it gets squirreled away by rich people scamming the system. Give aid to people, people will support the businesses"
"All of that money sent to foreign aid, yet their are homeless people that actually did military service out on the streets."
It‚Äôs all about debasing the dollar. I‚Äôm surprised they decline ANY spending.
# AMERICA FOR SALE
What other pork was in the bill though....
"The republicans want to destroy the ecosystem for political ends, the same way they did to Carter.

Punish them at the polls for their treason."
America is such a mess.
Why do Republicans hate small business?
"Just like the baby formula shortage and to fight gas Increase. 

Yes , this too was once again voted NO by almost every Republican"
"You forgot pre-2014. Nuland rattles off the figure of $5 billion on a tapped phone call while the Maidan is brewing, who knows how many years(months) that covered."
Radical idea: give all $110B back to taxpayers.
Ukraine is America‚Äôs laundromat üôÑ
"I'm intrigued by the number of comments here defensively reacting as though the OP posted something which openly blamed their preferred political party. You guys feeling guilty or something?

That's how the system works. Republicans play the bad guy for Democrats and Democrats play the bad guy for Republicans. Nothing new there. Probably all agreed on who would tank this bill behind closed doors. It's a good move when one voting no plays to their base and the other voting yes plays to their base, and no one has to actually pass the bill. That's how you get free brownie points."
""" small business ""


In other words, another hundred trillion dollars to the wealthy 0.001%. 

Another quadrillion to the top 100 families.  

That is not good even for them.

They will just waste it on mansions that will burn in Colorado, Nevada, California, Laguna Niguel , Los Angeles , and Orange County.

And on imported Italian cars, bad art, and even worse restaurant food."
Because Ukraine Gives Kickbacks to American Politicians
If you haven‚Äôt figured out Ukraine is just their money laundering operation I don‚Äôt know what to tell ya
Call it what it isn‚Äôt: treason.
"US small businesses and restaurants aren't laundering money to them, of course they blocked it"
"To be honest, at this point I‚Äôm done with all their ‚Äúsmall business‚Äù talk anyway. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, no aid should go to ukraine. But small business is just a catch phrase to create a false idea in the mind of the person hearing or reading it. By definition, ‚Äúsmall business‚Äù can include up to 1500 employees, and 39.5 million in business a year. So, trump is a small business owner. Pelosi is likely a small business owner. Musk and bezos are ‚Äúsmall business owners‚Äù. I‚Äôd expect the vast majority of multi millionaires and billionaires, and all mega corporations are ‚Äúsmall business‚Äù owners as well. It‚Äôs time to retire legislation for ‚Äúsmall businesses‚Äù or severely restrict the definition of it. 

By this definition 90%+ of Americans are employed by ‚Äúsmall business owners‚Äù and they‚Äôve used this to give people the false impression that the vast majority of Americans work for mom and pop style, small margin, one wage increase away from bankruptcy style family businesses. This isn‚Äôt the case, and it‚Äôs strange that so many Americans were so willing to believe that the vast majority of Americans work for mom and pops, and not the easy to see with your eyes reality, that the vast majority of us work for oligarchs who buy legislation and fight the workers for money and power."
"This just in - people not understanding how money is spent or purposefully conflating the issue of foreign aid. 

It's not like the US gives *many nations* billions of dollars a year in foreign aid or anything either. 

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_foreign_aid

It's cool though. Thank the GOP for voting against help for small businesses, just like they did for baby formula during a national shortage and capping gas prices from price gouging.

It‚Äôs called money laundering
This shouldn‚Äôt be a partisan issue. The elected leaders of BOTH parties are proving that none of them are interested in doing what‚Äôs best for the American people. 99% of politicians from both parties should be voted out and replaced with first time legislators that aren‚Äôt beholden to donors/corporations.
This is because this war is the US war against Russia in Ukranian territory. Not Russia - Ukraine war
"SS : They have donated billions of dollars to Ukraine but when the Americans need money for their business, it's get blocked.. Looks like small business in Ukraine needs more money then Americans 

It's all about priorities üíµüí∏üíµüí∏üíµüí∏üíµ

The weapons industry don't care about small businesses.
This isn't even a conspiracy. üòÇ ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Where is the conspiracy?
What if Ukraine was a US front country for money laundering?
"I love when halfwits use a word like 'treason' without the first fucking clue what the word means. 

Not the first fucking clue."
"Sad thing is there's nothing we can do. They send ""aid money"" to countries/people/corps they're in bed with and mock us by blocking shit like this. It's disrespectful to every one that works their ass off and these POS decide where to delegate our money is utter bullshit."
"But it's Elon Musk's job to solve world hunger, apparently..."
"Maybe I am wrong here:

- Supporting Ukraine helps to indirectly, or potentially directly cripple Russia‚Äôs economy.
- Crippling Russia‚Äôs economy might be the best interest of the U.S. to retain its Global strength/power. Not sure.
- The U.S. seems to be making moves to ensure that the US Dollar has the best chance of retaining its power as the World Reserve Currency. 
- By exclusively focusing on external foreign/international economic problems, the U.S. is failing to take care of its internal economic problems. 
- Internal economic problems are causing major political divide, major wealth gap between rich & poor, and major social unrest issues
- Major political divide and increasing wealth gap help with maintaining control via Divide & conquer strategy.

Uhm wasn't is mostly Republicans and all gop members who voted that down? Just like they voted no on gapping gas prices? Just like they voted no to fix the formula shortage? Right after bitching about both issues?
How about all those Republicans blocking financial aid to the baby food shortage? This sub going to ever complain about that?
This isn‚Äôt a conspiracy. It‚Äôs just shitty.
"Only 5 of the 50 GOP senators voted yea, whereas only one independent or democratic senators voted nay, it‚Äôs not exactly a secret that the GOP doesn‚Äôt have the average American in mind."
I think a lot of that money was a loan. We own Ukraine now. They will never be able to pay us back.
"Its not a right vs left, republican vs democrats - its and us vs them...the ruling class and the plebs....they hate us. Wake up"
You do realise they don‚Äôt ‚Äò*give*‚Äô these countries money? It‚Äôs a high interest loan.
Who is even collecting this cash? Ukrainian leaders? Is it going to someone‚Äôs pockets and not going to Ukraine? This is weird
Hopefully its at least going to ukraine small businesses../s
"This isn‚Äôt surprising, they haven‚Äôt cared about the people for decades."
"According to this, just 6 billion dollars could save 42 million lives:

it's almost like the republicans are blocking the aid package instead of the usual demon rats /s
They're back to Democrat vs. Republican in this sub again. Deny that BOTH parties sent the $$$.
Ukraine is pretty important. If Ukraine easily fell there would be a lot more to worry about.
"This argument is dumb as absolute fuck. Think about it you guys: capitalism is survival of the fittest. You cant have corporate welfare, that‚Äôs called communism, you got to let the weak companies die off‚Ä¶.

We are spending money to help stop authoritarianism and promote democracy. If we help Ukraine win this war Russia might even switch teams to the west after Putin loses power and the country reconsiders their priorities‚Ä¶

Then it will be the whole world vs China and the world will be a much safer place. Stop with this bull shit argument, it‚Äôs important af to destabilize Russia. They have gotten away with too much for too long"
Controlled demolition. Great Reset.
Fuck this Clown worldüñïüñï
Hints why everything fucking costs so much thanks republicans whom run America with there dirty money they don't want to spend to help there own country.
"It‚Äôs not about supporting Ukraine, it‚Äôs about keeping the military industrial complex fed in a time of peace.  All that shit they are sending us getting replaced by US factories."
"My dad and I are small business owners. We absolutely think the last couple years has transpired like it has to put us and people like us out of business. Even though it‚Äôs hard and my dad is 75, we still fight these globalist scum every day. Because we don‚Äôt give up. Never. Fuck em."
That's because Republicans want Americans to suffer so they can blame the negative effects on Biden. Ask them why they didn't support this bill.
"Wrong. 
They are sending themselves that money. Ukraine just takes a cut and washes the rest for them."
The absolute density of bot comments and votes in this thread trying to distract people with R vs D stupidity.
Where my Republicans shills at??
It's not treason if they're truly following orders from their superiors. We're just getting fucked in the process.
"So does this money actually directly go to Ukraine? Or does it go to the IMF or someshit? 

And does it need to be repaid?"
"Why would they give aid after working so hard to destroy small businesses in the past 2 years?

After the Great Reset, we'll only get our goods from a One World Company. 

And for years young people have been told that the solution for stagnant wages was to start their own business lol."
It's just printed monopoly money chill out
Can't Ukraine have small businesses and restaurants? /S
"Ukraine? Seems like there is a typo.

Sent Money to ~~Ukraine~~ Politicians' Pockets

&#x200B;

FTFY"
The 1.7 trillion tax cut for people who don‚Äôt need a tax cut. Did that take any money away from small business men?
"As a Ukrainian born US Citizen, I couldn‚Äôt agree more, I‚Äôd like to see them to something in America first before antagonizing a war in other countries and pouring money in after the president and his son had shady business in ukraine. America needs to get its fat fingers out of other countries problems, they can even help themselves, and any help they provide isn‚Äôt solely because they care but because of an agenda."
Something is really fishy here
Fucking agreed.
"Oh! I get it!

Build back better was for everyone but the US."
"I love that /r/conspiracy is pro small business

Stop Spending Money We Do Not Have
This country is in rough shape and the government would rather give money away to Ukraine than to help its citizens.
Yeah I wouldn‚Äôt give it to the small businesses either. Your business is failing for a reason.
Remember when the dems where the anti war party?  Seems like they‚Äôd agree to a direct hot war with Russia no questions asked.
